Intro:
[Am][F][G]

[Am] [F][G]

Verse:
[Am]  We had [Am]broken up for good
Just an [F]hour before
Ahah[G]ah, ahahahah, aaah[Am]
And now I'm staring at the bodies
As they're [F]dancing 'cross the floor
Ahah[G]ah, ahahahah, aaah[Am]
And then the band slowed the tempo
And the [F]music gets you down
Ahah[G]ah, ahahahah, aaah[Am]
It was the same old song
With a [F]melancholy sound
Ahah[G]ah, ahahahah, aaah[Am]

Chorus:
[F] They don't write[C] 'em like that anymore[G]
[Dm]   [F] They just don't [C]write 'em like that anymore[G]

Verse:
We'd been[Am]  living together for a [F]million years
Ahah[G]ah, ahahahah, aaah[Am]
But now it feels so strange out of the[F]atmospheres
Ahah[G]ah, ahahahah, aaah[Am]
And then the jukebox plays a song I[F]used to know
Ahah[G]ah, ahahahah, aaah[Am]
And now I'm staring at the bodies
As they're [F]dancing so slow
Ahah[G]ah, ahahahah, aaah[Am]

Chorus:
[F] They don't write[C] 'em like that anymore[G]
[Dm]   [F] They just don't [C]write 'em like that anymore[G]

Interlude:
[Am] [F][G]

Verse:
[Am][F][G]

[Am]  Mmmm, now I wind up staring at an [F]empty glass
Ahah[G]ah, ahahahah, aaah[Am]
'Cos it's so easy to say
That she'll for[F]get your past
Ahah[G]ah, ahahahah, aaah[Am]

Chorus:
[F] They don't write[C] 'em like that anymore[G]
[Dm]  No,[F] they just don't [C]write 'em like that anymore[G]
[F] They don't write[C] 'em like that anymore[G]
[Dm]   [F] They just don't [C]write 'em like that anymore[G]

Outro:
[F] They just don't,[C] no, they don't,[G] no no,[Dm]uhuh
[F] They just don't write[C] 'em like that anymore[G]
