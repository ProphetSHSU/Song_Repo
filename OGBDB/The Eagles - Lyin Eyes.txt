Verse:
[G]City girls just [G7M]seem to find out ear[C]ly
[Am]How to open doors with just a smile.
[D7]  A [G]rich old man
And [G7M]she won't have to wor[C]ry.
She'll [Am]dress up all in lace[C] and go in style.[G]

Verse:
[G]Late at night a [G7M]big old house gets lone[C]ly.
I guess [Am]every form of refuge has its price,[D7]
And it [G]breaks her heart to [G7M]think her love is
On[C]ly given [Am]to a man with hands[C]as cold as ice.

Verse:
[G]  [C]  [D7]  So she [G]tells him she must [G7M]go out for the eve[C]ning,
To [Am]comfort an old friend who's feelin'down,
[D7]  But [G]he knows where she's go[G7M]in' as she's [C]leavin'.
She is [Am]headed for the [C]cheatin' side of town.

Chorus:
[G] You can't [G]hide[C/G]your lyin' eyes,
[G]  [Am/C]     [G] And your[D/F#]     [Em]smile[Bm]  is a thin dis[Am]guise.
[D7]  I thought by [G]now[F/G]   you'd realize,[C]
[A7]  There [Am]ain't no way to hide[D7]your lyin' eyes.

[G][G7M][C][Am]

[D7] [G]

Verse:
On the [G]other side of town[G7M]   a boy is wai[C]ting,
With [Am]fiery eyes and dreams[Am7]   noone could [D7]steal.
She [G]drives on through the [G7M]night anticipa[C]ting,
'Cause he [Am]makes her feel the [C]way she used to feel.[G]

Verse:
[C]  [D7]  She [G]rushes to his arms,
[G7M]   They fall to[C]gether.
She [Am]whispers that it's only for a [D7]while.
She [G]swears that soon she'll be [G7M]comin' back fore[C]ver.
She [Am]pulls away and [C]leaves him with a smile.[G]

Chorus:
You can't [G]hide[C/G]your lyin' eyes,
[G]  [Am/C]     [G] And your[D/F#]     [Em]smile[Bm]  is a thin dis[Am]guise.
[D7]  I thought by [G]now[F/G]   you'd realize.[C]
[A7]  There [Am]ain't no way to hide[D7]your lyin' eyes.

[G][G7M][C][Am]

[D7] [G]

Verse:
[G]She gets up and [G7M]pours herself a strong[C]one
And [Am]stares out at the stars up in the sky
[D7]  A[G]nother night, it's [G7M]gonna be a long[C]one
She [Am]draws the shade and hangs[C]her head to cry

Verse:
[G]  [C]  [D7]  She [G]wonders how it [G7M]ever got this [C]crazy.
She [Am]thinks about a boy she knew in school.
[D7]  Did [G]she get tired or [G7M]did she just get la[C]zy?
She's [Am]so far gone she feels[C] just like a fool.[G]

Verse:
[G]My, oh my, you [G7M]sure know how to arrange[C]things.
You [Am]set it up so well, so careful[D7]ly.
Ain't it [G]funny how your new[G7M]   life didn't change[C]things.
You're [Am]still the same old [C]girl you used to be.

Chorus:
[G] You can't [G]hide[C/G]your lyin' eyes,
[G]  [Am/C]     [G] And your[D/F#]     [Em]smile[Bm]  is a thin dis[Am]guise.
[D7]  I thought by [G]now [F/G]you'd realize,[C]
[A7]  There [Am]ain't no way to hide[D7]your lyin' eyes.
