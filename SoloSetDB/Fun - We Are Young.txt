Verse:
[C]Give me a second I

I need to get my story straight
My fr[Am]iends are in the bathroom

Getting higher than the empire state
My lo[Dm]ver she's waiting for me

Just across the bar
My seats been [F]taken by some sunglasses
[G]Asking 'bout a scar

And [C]I know I gave it to you months ago
[Am]I know you're trying to forget
But bet[Dm]ween the drinks and subtle things

The holes in my apologies
You know[F] I'm trying hard to take it[G]back

Bridge:
So if by the t[Dm]ime the [Em]bar closes
And you f[Am]eel like f[G]alling d[F]own
I'll ca[F]rry you [G]home

Chorus:
To[C]night
We are [Am]young
So let's set the world on [F]fire

We can burn brighter
Than the [Gsus4]sun[G]
To[C]night
We are [Am]young
So let's set the world on [F]fire

We can burn brighter
Than the [Gsus4]sun[G]

Verse:
Now I k[C]now that I'm not

All that you got
I [Am]guess that I
I just thought maybe we could find a ways to fall apa[Dm]rt

But our friends are back

So let's raise a cup
[F] Cause I found someone to [G]carry me home

Chorus:
To[C]night
We are [Am]young
So let's set the world on [F]fire

We can burn brighter
Than the [Gsus4]sun[G]
To[C]night
We are [Am]young
So let's set the world on [F]fire

We can burn brighter
Than the [Gsus4]sun[G]
Bridge:
C[C]arry me home toni[F]ght
Just [C/E]carry me home ton[G]ight
[C]Carry me home to[F]night
Just c[C]arry me home ton[G]ight

[C]The world is on my side [F]I have no reason to run
[C/E]So will someone come and ca[G]rry me home tonight
[C]The angels never arrived [F]but I can hear the choir
[C/E]so will someone come and c[G]arry me home

Chorus:
To[C]night
We are [Am]young
So let's set the world on [F]fire

We can burn brighter
Than the [Gsus4]sun[G]
To[C]night
We are [Am]young
So let's set the world on [F]fire

We can burn brighter
Than the [Gsus4]sun[G]

Bridge:
So if by the t[Dm]ime the [Em]bar closes
And you f[Am]eel like f[G]alling d[F]own
I'll ca[F]rry you [G]home ton[C]ight
