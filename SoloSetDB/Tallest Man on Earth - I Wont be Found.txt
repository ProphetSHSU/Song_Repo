Verse:
[G]Well if I ever see the [Em]morning
[C]Just like a lizard in the [D]spring
[G]I’m gonna run out in the[Em]meadow
[C]To catch the silence when it[D]sings

[G]I’m gonna force the Ser[Em]engeti
[C]To disappear into my eyes[D]
[G]Then when I hear your vo[Em]ices callin’
[C]I’m gonna turn just inside o[D]ut

Chorus:
[C]Well if I ever get to [G]slumber
[C]Just like a mole deep in the[D]ground
[D]Hell, I won’t be [G]found

Verse:
[G]Deep in the dust forgot[Em]ten gathered
[C]I grow a diamond in my che[D]st
[G]I make reflections as th[Em]e moon shines on
[C]Turn to a villain as I rest[D]

Chorus:
[C]Well if I ever get to [G]slumber
[C]Just like a mole deep in the[D]ground
[D]Hell, I won’t be [G]found

Bridge:
[Em]I know there is a hollow
[G]I need to fill it with a d[C]raft
Of all the words that I wont[D]say
[Em]And with a quiet whisper
[G]I send a curse upon the[Em]day
That never used the sun to[C]see
[D]The light

Verse:
[G]I’m gonna float up in t[Em]he ceiling
[C]I built a levee of the sta[D]rs
[G]And in my field of tired[Em]horses
[C]I built a freeway through th[D]is farce

Chorus:
[C]Well if I ever get to [G]slumber
[C]I’ll be a mole deep under gr[D]ound
[D]and I won’t be fo[G]und
