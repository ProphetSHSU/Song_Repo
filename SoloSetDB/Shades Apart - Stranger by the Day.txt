Snow is falling from the sk[Dm]y ,  In the middle o[G]f July
Sun was shining in my[C] eyes again [Am]last night
Alarm goes off without a s[Dm]ound , the si[E]lence is so loud
Something isn[Am]'t right

Footsteps echo down [Dm]the hall,  no one[G]'s there at all
Dial your number b[C]ut your voice sa[Am]ys "I'm not home"
Everything is in[Dm]side out - I don't know wh[E]at it's about ......

Chorus:
It keeps getting s[C]tranger [G]by t[F]he d[G]ay
[C]stranger[G] by the [F]day[G]
it[G] keeps gett[C]ing stranger by t[G]he day[F]
s[G]tranger by the da[Am]y....................

Going for a walk ou[Dm]tside,  to see wha[G]t I can find
No reflections in the[C] windows I pa[Am]ss by
It feels hotter in the [Dm]shade,  water's ru[E]nning up the drain
Something'[Am]s going on

Conversations with a m[Dm]ime,  stared at[G]by the blind
Imagination must [C]be working over[Am]time
The world is upsi[Dm]de down,  everything is t[E]urned around.......

Chorus:
It keeps getting s[C]tranger [G]by t[F]he d[G]ay
[C]stranger[G] by the [F]day[G]
it[G] keeps gett[C]ing stranger by t[G]he day[F]
s[G]tranger by the da[Am]y....................

By the time I reach your d[Dm]oor,   I can't t[G]ake anymore
I just happened to[C] be in your neig[Am]hborhood
I'm the one who gets[Dm] surprised,   I don't beli[E]eve my eyes
Your alibi's[Am]no good
Wha[Dm]tev[G]er hap[C]pened to the world,   whatever happened to the girl
I thought I k[Am]new

[Dm][E]

It just can't b[G]e true,  I guess I'm losing you ........yeaaaahh

Chorus:
It keeps getting s[C]tranger [G]by t[F]he d[G]ay
[C]stranger[G] by the [F]day[G]
it[G] keeps gett[C]ing stranger by t[G]he day[F]
s[G]tranger by the da[Am]y
[C]stranger[G] by the [F]day[G]
s[G]tranger by the da[Am]y.
