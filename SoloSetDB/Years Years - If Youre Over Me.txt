Verse:
[D]It's like thunder and lightn[G]ing
You hurt me without trying[Bm]
A tempest, you was rising[G]

And no I don't like to be this way
[D]And you're Jekyll and Hydein[G]'
Are you real or are you lying[Bm]?
So stop with your crying[G]

I can't handle it now

Pre-Chorus:
[D]You tell eve[G]ryone our love wen[Bm]t cold
Go[G]ing round, spreading the word, it's over
[D]If that's how you[G] feel then you shoul[Bm]d go
[G]Don't come around saying, "I still want you"

Chorus:
[D]One minute you say we're a [G]team
Then you're telling me you can't br[Bm]eathe
Well you should set me f[G]ree
Baby, if you're over [D]me
Yesterday you said I'm the [G]one
But now you say you're d[Bm]one

Stop telling me what I n[G]eed
Baby, if you're over [D]me

Verse:
[D]There you go, there, I said i[G]t
Don't look at me all offen[Bm]ded
You played games and it end[G]ed

I've got to look out for me
[D]I won't say that it's eas[G]y
Oh, I know I hate leavin[Bm]g
But you can't keep deceivi[G]ng

Does it make you feel good?

Pre-Chorus:
[D]You tell ever[G]yone our love went[Bm]cold
[G]Going round, spreading the word, it's over
[D]If that's how you[G] feel then you shoul[Bm]d go
[G]Don't come around saying, "I still want you"

Chorus:
[D]One minute you say we're a [G]team
Then you're telling me you can't b[Bm]reathe
Well you should set me f[G]ree

Baby, if you're over [D]me
Yesterday you said I'm the [G]one
But now you say you're d[Bm]one
Stop telling me what I [G]need
Baby, if you're over [D]me
If you're over m[G]e
If you're over m[Bm]e
Stop telling me what I [G]need

Baby, if you're over me

Bridge:
[Bm]How long can a love rema[F#m]in?
Time never could heal this [G]pain
I thought I believed in f[A]ate
Oh, it's so cr[Bm]uel
No, nothing for us would ch[F#m]ange

Same story, the same mistake
[A]This heart just wants to break

Chorus:
[D]One minute you say we're a [G]team
Then you're telling me you can't br[Bm]eathe

Well you should set me [G]free
Baby, if you're over [D]me
Yesterday you said I'm the [G]one
But now you say you're d[Bm]one
Stop telling me what I n[G]eed
Baby, if you're over [D]me

Outro:
[D]Just go if it's [G]over
Just go if it's o[Bm]ver
Just go if it's o[G]ver
Baby, if you're over m[D]e
Just go if it's o[G]ver
Just go if it's o[Bm]ver
Just go if it's o[G]ver
Baby, if you're over [D]me
