Despe[E]rad[E7]o, why don't you
[A] come to your s[Am]enses?
You been [E]out ridin' fe[Dbm7]nces 
for [Gb7]so long [B7]now
Oh, you're a [E]hard one[E7], I know that 
[A]you got your rea[Am]sons,
These [E]things that [Ab7]are ple[Dbm7]asin' 
you can [Gb7]hurt you [B7]somehow 

[E][B]

Don't you [Dbm]draw the queen of [Abm]diamonds boy,
She'll [A]beat you if she's [E]able,
You know the [Dbm7]queen of hearts is 
[A]always your best [E]bet [B]
Now it [Dbm]seems to me some [Abm]fine things have been 
[A]laid upon your [E]table
But you [Dbm]only want the [Gb7]ones you can't [B]get

De[B7]sper[E]ado[E7], oh you ain't 
[A]gettin' no you[Am]nger,
Your [E]pain and your hu[Dbm7]nger, 
they're [Gb7]drivin' you [B7]home
And [E]freedom[E7], well, that's just 
[A]some people ta[Am]lkin'
Your [E]prison [Ab7]is wa[Dbm7]lkin' 
through this [Gb7]world all a[B7]lone

[E][B]

Don't your [Dbm]feet get cold in the [Abm]winter time?
The [A]sky won't snow and [E]the sun won't shine
It's [Dbm7]hard to tell the [A]night time from the 
[E]day [B]
You're [Dbm]losin' all your [Abm]highs and lows
Ain't it [A]funny how the [E]feelin' goes a[Gbm7]way

[B]Des[B7]per[E]ado[E7], why don't you 
[A]come to your se[Am]nses
Come [E]down from [B]your fe[Dbm]nces,
[Gb7] open the [B7]gate
It may be [E]rainin'[E7],  but there's a 
[A]rainbow abov[Am]e you
You better [E]let some[Ab7]body 
[Dbm]love you, [A][Gbm7]
You better [E]let some[Ab7]body [Dbm]love you 
be[Gbm7]fore it's [B7]too [E]late 
[E7][A][Am][E]
