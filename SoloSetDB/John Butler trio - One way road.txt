Verse 1
G              D 
They come they take
Em                           C
Its never enough because they cant relate
G               D  Em                          C
To the real world, thinking that the oyster is just for the pearl
G                D
They start those wars
Em                        C
They want to own the land sea and all the stars
G                 D
And right those wrongs
Em                                   C        
they change their history with their poison forked tongues.
Verse 2
G-D-Em-C
All right, whos they?
A maybe its the government of today
Or B for the big business man who thinks the whole world revolves around him
Or C for the corrupt official for A and B he be the man in the middle
Or D for discoverer for Cook and Columbus and the pirate plunderers.

Doesnt mean I aint gonna stop now just because I dont got a gun
Asus4                                C
The lyrical is heavier than lead and this guitar is my canon
Asus4                                C
Just like my Martin and Mahatma I'm gonna love Im gonna over come
Asus4                                C
Maybe its E for all of the above but I dont want to be
Riff 1

Chorus
G-D-Em-C
Wrong way going down the one way road
Wrong way going down the one way road
Wrong way going down the one way road
Gonna turn it all around gonna back it on up
Wrong way going down the one way road
Wrong way going on a one way road
Wrong way going down the one way road
Gonna turn it all around gonna back it on up

Verse 3
G-D-Em-C
These men who they say we should follow
BUT we cant follow men if their hearts are hollow and
Mmmm yes how can we respect puppet regimes we do not elect?
Straight up straight up staight up like Pinocchio
And every time they lie man the fire just grows so
im gonna be a part of the solution
Raise up your fists if you believe in revolution

Doesnt mean I aint gonan fight now
Just because I dont got a gun
The lyrical is heavier than lead and
This guitar is my canon
Just like my Martin and Mahatma
I'm gonna love Im gonna over come
Maybe its E for all of the above but I dont want to be

Chorus

Wrong way going on a one way road
Wrong way going down the one way road
Gonna turn it all around gonna back it on up
