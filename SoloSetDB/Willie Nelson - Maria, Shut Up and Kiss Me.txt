[C]That's my [F]favorite par[Dm]t   [G7]       [C]to rew[F]ind my l[Dm]ife on[G7].

[C]When my wo[F]rld got dark[Dm]    [G7]       [C]you tu[F]rned my [Dm]light [G7]on.

[F]I've watched it for hours again and again in my he[C]ad. I did.

[G7]You said I was down on you more than I needed to be.

I say I'm sorry but then you think I'm lying.

[C]Maria, s[F]hut up and kiss me.

[Dm]Stop shaking, stan[G7]d up and hold me.

[C]I bet you're [F]gonna miss me.

[Dm]You need me, beli[G7]eve me.

[C]Maria, s[F]hut up and kiss me.

[Dm]You're crazy [G7]and it turns me [C]on and on[F]

The way [Dm]you're carrying on.[G7]

[C]Well that'[F]s my favorit[Dm]e sh[G7]irt    [C]you al[F]ways had[Dm] on.[G7]

[C]And it sur[F]e looked goo[Dm]d   [G7]       [C]every [F]time you[Dm] walk [G7]on.

[F]You've taken the wind from me every chance that you c[C]ould. You're good.
[G7]Some things I can't explain tell me lately I've changed.

You'll feel better, tell me why are you crying.

[C]Maria, s[F]hut up and kiss me.

[Dm]Stop shaking, stan[G7]d up and hold me.

[C]I bet you're [F]gonna miss me.

[Dm]You need me, beli[G7]eve me.

[C]Maria, s[F]hut up and kiss me.

[Dm]You're crazy [G7]and it turns me [C]on and on[F]

The way [Dm]you're carrying on.[G7]

Bridge:
[F]Maria, Maria, can we talk it over inst[C]ead?

[F]Let's call it even and leave it alone, come to b[C]ed.

[F]Maria stop leaving, your teasing is beating me d[C]own.

[G7]Maria just calm down. In these situations I've found

It's best not to be proud and say that you're sorry.

[C]Maria, s[F]hut up and kiss me.

[Dm]Stop shaking, stan[G7]d up and hold me.

[C]I bet you're [F]gonna miss me.

[Dm]You need me, beli[G7]eve me.

[C]Maria, s[F]hut up and kiss me.

[Dm]You're crazy [G7]and it turns me [C]on and on[F]

The way [Dm]you're carrying on.[G7]
