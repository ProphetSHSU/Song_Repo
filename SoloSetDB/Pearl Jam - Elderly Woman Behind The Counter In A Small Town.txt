Verse:
[D]I [Cadd9]seem to [G]recognize your [Cadd9]face[G]
[D]Haunt[Cadd9]ing fam[G]iliar, yet I cant [Cadd9]seem to [G]place it
[D]Cannot fi[Cadd9]nd the [G]candle of thought to [Cadd9]light your [G]name
[D]Lifet[Cadd9]imes are [G]catchin' up with [Cadd9]me[G]

Pre-Chorus:
[C]All these [A]changes taking p[C]lace
I [A]wish i’d seen the p[C]lace
But [A]no-one’s ever [Em]taken me

Chorus:
[D]Hearts and [Cadd9]thoughts they [G]fade, [Cadd9]fade a[G]way
[D]Hearts and [Cadd9]thoughts they [G]fade, [Cadd9]fade a[G]way

Verse:
[D]I [Cadd9]swear I [G]recognise your [Cadd9]breath[G]
[D]Memor[Cadd9]ies, like [G]fingerprints are [Cadd9]slowly [G]raising
[D]Me, you [Cadd9]wouldn't re[G]call, for I'm [Cadd9]not my [G]former
[D]It's hard wh[Cadd9]en you're [G]stuck upon the [Cadd9]shelf[G]
Pre-Chorus:
[C]I changed by [A]not changing at [C]all
Small [A]town predicts my [C]fate
Per[A]haps that's what no one [Em]wants to see

Bridge:
[D]I just [Cadd9]want to [G]scream, "hel[Cadd9]lo!"[G]
[D]My [Cadd9]god, it's [G]been so long, never [Cadd9]dreamed you'd [G]return
[D]But now [Cadd9]here you [G]are and [Cadd9]here I [G]am
[D]Hearts and [Cadd9]thoughts they [G]fade [Cadd9]away[G]

Chorus:
[D]Hearts and [Cadd9]thoughts they [G]fade, [Cadd9]fade a[G]way
[D]Hearts and [Cadd9]thoughts they [G]fade, [Cadd9]fade a[G]way
[D]Hearts and [Cadd9]thoughts they [G]fade, [Cadd9]away[G]
[D]Hearts and [Cadd9]thoughts they [G]fade, [Cadd9]fade a[G]way (3x fade out)
