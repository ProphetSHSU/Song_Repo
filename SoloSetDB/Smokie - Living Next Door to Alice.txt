Verse:
[A]Sally called when she got the word.[D]
And she said: "I suppose you've heard [E]- about[A] Alice[E]".
When I [A]rushed to the window, and I looked outside,
[D]and I could hardly believe my [E]eyes.
And[E] the big limousine rolled up, int[A]o Alice's dr[E]ive.

Chorus:
Oh, I [A]don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go.
I [D]guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't wanna know.
Cause for [E]twenty-four years I've been living next door to [A]Alice[E].
[A]Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance,
to [D]tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance,
now I've [E]got to get used to not [D]living next door to [A]Alice[E].

Verse:
[A]We grew up together, two kids in the park.[D]
We carved our initials, deep in the bark. [E]Me and A[A]lice[E]
Now she [A]walks to the door with her head held high
[D]Just for a moment I caught her eye
[E]As the limousine pulls out, of [A]Alice's driv[E]e

Chorus:
Oh, I [A]don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go.
I [D]guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't wanna know.
Cause for [E]twenty-four years I've been living next door to [A]Alice[E].
[A]Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance,
to [D]tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance,
now I've [E]got to get used to not [D]living next door to [A]Alice[E].

Verse:
Then[A] Sally called back and asked how I felt,[D]
And she said: "I know how to help [E]- get ove[A]r Alice".[E]
She said: "Now[A]Alice is gone, but I'm still here,
[D]you know I've been waiting for twenty-four years..."[E]
N.C.
And the big limousine disappeared…

Chorus:
Oh, I [A]don't know why she's leaving, or where she's gonna go.
I [D]guess she's got her reasons, but I just don't wanna know.
Cause for [E]twenty-four years I've been living next door to [A]Alice[E].
[A]Twenty-four years just waiting for a chance,
to [D]tell her how I feel, and maybe get a second glance,
now I've [E]got to get used to not [D]living next door to [A]Alice[E].

Outro:
No, I'll [E]never get used to not [D]living next door to [A]Alice...
