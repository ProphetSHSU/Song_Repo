Intro:
[C][G][Am7][G/B][C][D]
[G]

Verse:
[G]Grandpa, tell me 'bout the [C]good old days
Sometimes it [G]feels like, like this world's gone[D]crazy
And [G]Grandpa, take me back to [C]yesterday
When the line between [G]right and wrong
[D] Didn't seem so[G]hazy

Chorus:
[G] Did lovers really [C]fall in love to stay
And stand beside each [G]other, come what may?
Was a promise really [D]something people kept
Not just something they would [G]say
Did families really [C]bow their heads to pray
Did daddies really [G]never go away?
Oh, Grand[Am7]pa, tell [C]me 'bout the [D]good old days[G][C][G]

Verse:
[G]Grandpa, everything is [C]changing fast
Oh, we call it [G]progress, but I just don't know[D]
Grand[G]pa, let's wander back in[C]to the past
And paint me [G]the picture[D] of long[G]ago

Chorus:
[G] Did lovers really [C]fall in love to stay
And stand beside each [G]other, come what may?
Was a promise really [D]something people kept
Not just something they would say[G]and then forget
Did families really [C]bow their heads to pray
Did daddies really [G]never go away?
Oh, Grand[Am7]pa, tell[C] me 'bout the [D]good old days[G]
Oh, Grand[Am7]pa, tell[C] me 'bout the [D]good old days

Outro:
[G][C][G][Am7][G/B]
