Intro:
[Dm][G]
[Dm] [G]

Verse:
[Am]How can I just let you [Bm]walk away
Just let you [C]leave without a [Dm]trace,
When I [F]stand here taking [G]every breath with [Em]you, [Am]ooh.
You're the [Dm]only one who [F]really knew me at [G]all.
[Am]How can you just walk [Bm]away from me,
When all [C]I can do is watch you [Dm]leave,
Cause we've [F]shared the laughter [G]and the pain,
And [Em]even shared the [Am]tears.
You're the [Dm]only one who [F]really knew me at [G]all.[G7]

Chorus:
So take a look at me [C]now
Cause there's just an [D]empty space,
And there's [Am]nothing left here to [F]remind me,
Just the [Dm]memory of your [G]face.
Oh take a [G7]look at me [C]now
Cause there's just an [D]empty space,
And you coming [Am]back to me is [F]against the odds,
And that's [Dm]what I've got to [G]face.[G7]

Verse:
I [Am]wish I could just make you [Bm]turn around,
[C]Turn around and see me [Dm]cry,
There's so [F]much I need to [G]say to you,
So [Em]many reasons [Am]why.
You're the [Dm]only one who [F]really knew me at [G]all.[G7]

Chorus:
So take a look at me [C]now
Cause there's just an [D]empty space,
And there's [Am]nothing left here to [F]remind me,
Just the [Dm]memory of your [G]face.

Oh take a [G7]look at me [C]now
Cause there's just an [D]empty space,
But to [Am]wait for you, well that's [F]all I can do,
And that's [Dm]what I've got to [G]face.
Take a good [G7]look at me [C]now
Cause I'll still be [D]standing here,
And you coming [Am]back to me is [F]against all odds,
It's the [Dm]chance I've got to [G]take[G7]

Outro:
[Dm] [G][Dm][G]
[G7]Take a look[Dm] at me [G]now.
