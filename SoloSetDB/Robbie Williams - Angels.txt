[E] I sit and wait[E]

Verse 1:
Does an angel contemplate[A] my fate
[B] And do they know
[E] The places where we go
When we're grey and old[A]
[B] 'Cause I have been [F#m]told

Pre Chorus:
That salva[A]tion lets their wings[C#m] unfold
[A] So when I'm [D]lying in my bed
Thoughts [A/C#]running through my head
And I [E]feel the love is dead
[D] I'm loving [A/C#]angels instead

Chorus:
[E] And through it all[B] she offers me protec[C#m]tion
A lot of love and affec[A]tion
Whether I'm right or [E]wrong
And down the waterfall[B]
Wherever it may take[C#m]   me
I know that life won't break[A] me
When I come to call,[E/G#]    she won't for[F#m]sake me
[Dsus2] I'm loving [A/C#]angels instead[E]

Verse 2:
[E] When I'm feeling weak
And my pain walks down a one[A] way street
[B] I look above
[E] And I know I'll always be blessed[A] with love

Pre Chorus:
[B] And [D]as the feeling grows
She breathes [A/C#]flesh to my bones
And [E]when love is dead
[D] I'm loving [A/C#]angels instead

Chorus:
[E] And through it all[B] she offers me protec[C#m]tion
A lot of love and affec[A]tion
Whether I'm right or [E]wrong
And down the waterfall[B]
Wherever it may take[C#m]   me
I know that life won't break[A] me
When I come to call,[E/G#]    she won't for[F#m]sake me
[Dsus2]     I'm loving [A/C#]angels instead[E]

Chorus:
[E/G#] And through it all[B] she offers me protec[C#m]tion
A lot of love and affec[A]tion
Whether I'm right or [E]wrong

Wherever it may take[C#m]   me
I know that life won't break[A] me
When I come to call,[E/G#]    she won't for[F#m]sake me
[Dsus2] I'm loving [A/C#]angels instead[E]
