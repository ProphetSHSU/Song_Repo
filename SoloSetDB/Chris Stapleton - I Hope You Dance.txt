Intro:
[G] [Em7] [Cadd9]

Verse 1:
[G] I hope[G] you never lose 
your sense of wonder
You get your fill[Em7] to eat, 
but always keep that hunger
May you ne[Cadd9]ver take one 
single breath for granted
God forbid[D] love ever 
leave you empty handed

Verse 2:
I hope you still[Cadd9] feel small 
when you [D]stand beside the o[G]cean
Whenever one[Cadd9] door closes, 
I[D] hope one more o[G]pens
Promise me[Am7] that you'll give 
faith[Bm7] a fighting[Cadd9] chance
And when you get the choice 
to sit it out or[D] dance



Chorus:
I hope you dance[Em7][Cadd9]
[G] [D] I hope you dance
[Em7] [Cadd9] [D]

Verse 3:
I hope you [G]never 
fear those mountains in the distance
Never [Em7]settle for the 
path of least resistance
Livin' might[Cadd9] mean takin' chances, 
but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might[D] be a mistake, 
but it's worth makin'

Verse 4:
Don't let[Cadd9] some hellbent 
heart[D] leave you bit[G]ter
When you come close[Cadd9] to sellin' out,
[D] reconsid[G]er
Give the hea[Am7]vens above more[Bm7]
than just a passing[Cadd9] glance
And when you get the choice to 
sit it out or[D] dance
I hope you dance

Chorus:
[Em7][Cadd9] [G] [D] I hope you dance
[Em7] [Cadd9] [D] I hope you dance
[Em7][Cadd9][G] [D] I hope you dance
[Em7] [Cadd9] [D]

Bridge:
I hope you still[Cadd9] feel small 
when you [D]stand beside the ocean
[G] Whenever one[Cadd9] door closes, 
I[D] hope one more o[G]pens
Promise me[Am7] that you'll give 
faith[Bm7] a fighting[Cadd9]     chance
And when you get the choice to 
sit it out or[D] dance

Chorus:
[Em7]Dance[Cadd9]
[G]  [D] I hope you dance
[Em7] [Cadd9] [D] I hope you dance
[Em7][Cadd9][G]  [D] 
I hope you dance[Em7][Cadd9][D]
