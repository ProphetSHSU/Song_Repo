Verse:
[Am]As I sit on the edg[C]e of this neve[F]r made [C]bed
Old guitar in my lap a new tune in my head
There she stands in the doorway just brushin' her hair
It's my beautiful muse in her underwear

Chorus:
[F]And if I was t[C]hinkin' I'd be [F]thinkin' thank [C]God whoever you [F]are[C]
[Am]For the muse and this [C]old [F]guitar[C]
[Am]Times like these[C] so sweet and so[F] true[C]
[F]Thinkin's the last t[Am]hing that you[G] wanna [C]do

Verse:
[Am]As I sit on the e[C]nd of this d[F]irty old b[C]ar
Tryin' to work some things out and not gettin' too far
As I drown out the voices that are keepin' me down
There's a muse all alone on the other side of town

Chorus:
[F]And if I was [C]thinkin' I'd b[F]e thinkin' thank God[C] whoever yo[F]u are[C]
[Am]For all the whisk[C]ey in this dirty old bar[F][C]

[Am]Times like these[C] so sad but so t[F]rue[C]
[F]Thinkin's the last thin[Am]g that you wanna do[G][C]
Thinkin's the last thing that you wanna do

Verse:
[Am]As I sit on the bed i[C]n this hospital room[F][C]
Sheddin' a tear for the bride and groom
The tiniest voice starts to bellow and cry
It's my finest work yet if today I should die

Chorus:
[F]And if I was thinkin' I'[C]d be thinkin' thank God[F] whoever you are[C][F][C]
[Am]For the muse and the miracle right[C] here in my arms[F][C]

[Am]Times like these[C] so sweet and so[F] true[C]
[F]Thinkin's the last thin[Am]g that you wanna do[G][C]
Thinkin's the last thing that you wanna do
Thinkin's the last thing that you wanna do
