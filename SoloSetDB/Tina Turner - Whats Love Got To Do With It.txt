Intro:
[Em7] [D][Em7][D]

Verse:
[Em7]You must understand though the touch of your hand
Makes my pu[D]lse react
That it's [Em7]only the thrill of boy meeting girl
Opposit[D]es attract
It's [C]physi[D]cal, only l[C]ogic[D]al
You must t[C]ry to ignore that it m[D]eans more than that

Chorus:
[G]What's l[D]ove got to [C]do, got to [D]do with it
[G]What's l[D]ove but a se[C]cond hand e[D]motion
[G]What's l[D]ove got to d[C]o, got to do[D]with it
[G]Who needs a h[D]eart when a he[C]art can be br[D]oken

Verse:
[Em7]It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're[D]close to me
If I [Em7]tend to look dazed I've read it some place
I've got [D]cause to be
There's a n[C]ame for [D]it
There's a p[C]hrase that f[D]its
But what[C]ever the reason you [D]do it for me

Chorus:
[G]What's [D]love got to[C] do, got to[D]do with it
[G]What's [D]love but a s[C]econd hand [D]emotion
[G]What's l[D]ove got to d[C]o, got to do[D]with it
[G]Who needs a h[D]eart when a he[C]art can be br[D]oken

Break:
[A][E][D][E]

[A][E][D][E]
[A][E][D]

Bridge:
[G]I've been taking on a [A]new direction
[G]But I have to s[A]ay,
[F]I've been thinking about my [G]own protection
It s[Em7]cares me to feel this way[A]

Chorus:
[A]What's lo[E]ve got to d[D]o, got to d[E]o with it
[A]What's lo[E]ve but a se[D]cond hand e[E]motion
[A]What's lo[E]ve got to d[D]o, got to d[E]o with it
[A]Who needs a hea[E]rt when a h[D]eart can be broken[E]

[A]What's lo[E]ve got to d[D]o, got to d[E]o with it
[A]What's lo[E]ve but a [D]sweet old-fashioned [E]notion
[A]What's lo[E]ve got to d[D]o, got to d[E]o with it
[A]Who needs a hea[E]rt when a h[D]eart can be br[E]oken

[A]What's lo[E]ve,       [D](oooh,   [E]got to do with it)
[A]What's lo[E]ve but a [D]second hand e[E]motion
[A]What's lo[E]ve got to d[D]o, got to d[E]o with it
[A]Who needs a hea[E]rt when a h[D]eart can be br[E]oken
