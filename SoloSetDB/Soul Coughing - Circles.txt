Verse:

[F]When you were languis[C]hing in [Gm]rooms I built to file you[Bb] in
[F]And when the wind set [C]down in [Gm]funnel form and pulled yo[Bb]u in

Chorus:

[F]I don't need to [Gm]walk around in circles
Walk a[F]round in circles, walk around in [Gm]circles, walk around in
[F]Don't need to [Gm]walk around in circles
Walk a[F]round in circles, walk around in [Gm]circles, walk around in

Verse:

[F]And when the ghostly d[C]ust of [Gm]violence traces everyt[Bb]hing
[F]And when the gas r[C]uns out just [Gm]wreck it, you insured the[Bb] thing

Chorus:

[F]I don't need to [Gm]walk around in circles
Walk a[F]round in circles, walk around in [Gm]circles, walk around in
[F]Don't need to [Gm]walk around in circles
Walk a[F]round in circles, walk around in [Gm]circles, walk around in

Bridge:

[F]Doom da doom da doom Well I'm going, I'm going
[F]Doom da doom da doom Well I'm going, I'm going
[F]Doom da doom da doom Well I'm going, I'm going
[F]Doom da doom da doom Well I'm going, I'm going

Verse:

[F]But I can't sigh now [C]that you m[Gm]ade the move[Bb]
It has [F]gone and gone to dogs[C], [Gm]lay down on the floor[Bb]
[F]For the right price I[C] can get[Gm] everything[Bb]
[F]Slip into the car[C], go[Gm] driving to the fart[Bb]hest star

Chorus:

[F]I don't need to [Gm]walk around in circles
Walk a[F]round in circles, walk around in [Gm]circles, walk around in
[F]Don't need to [Gm]walk around in circles
Walk a[F]round in circles, walk around in [Gm]circles, walk around in
