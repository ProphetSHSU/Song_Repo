Verse:
She's sun and [D]rain, She's fire and [G]ice.
A little [A]crazy but it's [Bm]nice.[A]
And when [G]she gets mad you [D]best leave her alone.[A]

'Cause she'll [D]rage just like a [G]river,
then she'[A]ll beg you to for[Bm]give her.[A]
Oh she's [G]every woman [A]that I've ever [D]known.

Verse:
She's so New Y[D]ork and then L. A.[G]
And every [A]town along the [Bm]way.[A]
And she's [G]every place [D]that I've never been.[A]

She's making [D]Love on rainy nights.[G]
She's a [A]stroll through [Bm]christmas [A]lights
And she's [G]everything I [A]want to do again.[D]

Chorus:
[Bm]It needs no expla[G]nation,
[Bm]'Cause it all makes perfect [G]sense.
[D]For when it [A]comes down to tempta[Bm]tion,[A]
she's on [G]both sides of the [A]fence.

Verse:
She's any[D]thing but typical,[G]
She's so [A]unpre[Bm]dicta[A]ble.
Oh, but [G]even at her worst[D] she ain't that [A]bad.

She's as [D]real as real can [G]be,
And she's [A]every [Bm]fantas[A]y.

Ending:
Lord, she's [G]every lover [A]that I've ever [Bm]had.
And she's [G]every lover [A]that I've never [D]had.
