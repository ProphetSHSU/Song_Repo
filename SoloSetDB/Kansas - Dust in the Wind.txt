I [C]close [G]my [Am]eyes o[G]nly for a [Dm]moment and a m[Am]oment´s gone.
[C]All [G]my d[Am]reams p[G]ass before my [Dm]eyes a curio[Am]sity.
[D]Dust[G] in the w[Am]ind, a[D]ll we are is [G]dust in the [Am]wind.

[C]Same o[G]ld s[Am]ong, j[G]ust a drop of [Dm]water in the end[Am]less sea.
[C]All [G]we [Am]do, c[G]rumbles to the gro[Dm]und though we refu[Am]se to see.
[D]Dust[G] in the w[Am]ind, a[D]ll we are is [G]dust in the [Am]wind.

[C]Don't [G]hang [Am]on, n[G]othing last´s for[Dm]ever but the ea[Am]rth and sky.
[C]It [G]slips a[Am]way [G]all your money won´[Dm]t another m[Am]inute buy.
[D]Dust[G] in the w[Am]ind, a[D]ll we are is [G]dust in the [Am]wind
[D]Dust[G] in the w[Am]ind, e[D]verything is [G]dust in the [Am]wind.
