Intro:
[Em][D][C][D]

Verse:
[Em]Broken [D]stained glass let's the [C]light in
I'll be sitting [B]on [D]my own
[Em]Where the [D]hell's the silver [C]lining
Why'd you leave me all a[D]lone

[Em]I'm so over[D] waiting for a [C]miracle
[D]Only got one life
And we're [Bm]running out of time
So [Em]only you and I [D]were in[C]vincible[D]

I stand here [Em]singing hallelujah
[D]Don't care for it do you
You're not [C]here

I stand here [Em]screaming hallelujah
[D]Dedicated to [C]you
[C]I know you're here

[D]Could you [Em]come back to your body
[D]I could use somebody next to me[C]
I stand here [Em]singing hallelujah

Don't care for it [D]do you
[C]You're not here
[C]You gone cold at the altar

Bridge:
[Em][D][C]

Verse:
[Em]I could [D]feel myself un[C]winding
Am I more then flesh [D]and bones
The[Em] way you left me I was [C]blinded
In glass houses throwing [D]stones

[Em]I'm so over waiting for a [C]miracle
[D]Only got one life
And we're [Bm]running out of time
[Em]So only you and I were in[C]vincible[D]
I stand here [Em]singing hallelujah
[D]Don't care for it do you
[C]You're not here

I stand here [Em]screaming hallelujah
[D]Dedicated to [C]you

[C]I know you're here
[D]Could you [Em]come back to your body

I stand here [Em]singing hallelujah
Don't care for it [D]do you
[C]You're not here
[C]You gone cold at the altar

[Em]Oh oh oh [C]oh oh
[D]Cold at the altar
[Em]Oh oh oh [C]oh oh
[D]Cold at the altar

[Em]I stand here singing hallelujah
[D]Don't care for it do you

I stand here [Em]screaming hallelujah
[D]Dedicated to you
I [C]know you're here
[D]Could you come [Em]back to your body
