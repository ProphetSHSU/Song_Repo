Verse 1:
[D]I had visions I was in them I was looking into the [Am]mirror
To see a little bit [C]clearer, the [C/B]rottenness and evil in [D]me
[D]Fingertips have memories mine can't forget the curves of your [Am]body
And when I feel a bit [C]naughty, I [C/B]run it up the flagpole and [D]see

Who salutes, but no one ever does

Chorus:
[D]I'm not sick but I'm not [C/A]well, and I'm so [C]hot, [C4]cause I'm in [D]hell

Verse 2:
Been around the world and found that only stupid people are breeding
The cretins cloning and feeding, and I don't even own a tv
Put me in the hospital for nerves and then they had to commit me
You told them all I was crazy, they cut off my legs now
I'm an amputee god damn you

Chorus:
I'm not sick but I'm not well, and I'm so hot, cause I'm in hell
I'm not sick but I'm not well, and it's a sin, to live so well

Bridge:
[A]I wanna publish '[G]zines, and rage against [F/C]machines
I wanna [D2/F#]pierce my tongue, it doesn't hurt, it feels [A]fine
The trivial [G]sublime, I'd like to turn off [F/C]time
D2/F#  D11/F[D2/F#]#[D11/F#]
and kill my mind,        you kill my mind

Verse 3:
Paranoia, paranoia, everybody's comin' to get me
Just say you never met me, I'm going underground with the moles (to get holes)
Hear the voices in my head I swear to god it sounds like they're snoring
But if you're bored then you're boring, the agony and the irony
they're killing me...woah

Chorus:
I'm not sick but I'm not well, and I'm so hot cause I'm in hell
I'm not sick but I'm not well, and it's a sin to live so well
