Verse:
[D]In the middle of the [G]night

I go walking in my sleep
From the [G7]mountains of [C]faith
To a [Cmaj7]river so [D]deep
I must be looking for [G]something
Something sac[Am7/G]red I [G]lost
But the [G7]river is [C]wide
And it's [Cmaj7]too hard to [D]cross

Pre-Chorus:
[Em]Even though I know the 
[D6]river is wide
I walk [Cmaj7]down every evening and I 
[Bm7]stand on the shore
[Cmaj7]  I try to cross to the 
[Bm]opposite side
So I can [A]finally find out what I've been 
[D]looking [D6]for[Dm]

Chorus:
[D7] In the middle of the [G]night

I go walking in my sleep
Through the [G7]valley of [C]fear
To a [Cmaj7]river so [D]deep
And I've been sear[C]ching for [G]something
Taken ou[Am7/G]t of my [G]soul
Something [G7]I would never [C]lose
Something [Cmaj7]somebody [D]stole

Pre-Chorus:
[Em]  I don't know why I go 
[D6]walking at night
But now I'm [Cmaj7]tired and I don't want to 
[Bm7]walk anymore
[Cmaj7]  I hope it doesn't take the 
[Bm]rest of my life
Until I [A]find what it is that I've been 
[D]looking [D6]for[Dm]

Chorus:
[D7] In the middle of the [G]night
I go walking in my sleep
Through the [G7]jungle of [C]doubt
To a river so [D]deep
I know I'm searching for [G]something 
(Searching for [Am7/G]some- [G]thing)

Something so undefined 
(So Un-d[Am7/G]efi-  [G]ned)
That it can [G7]only be [C]seen
By the [Cmaj7]eyes of the [D]blind
In the middle of the [G]night

Piano Solo Over Chorus Chords:
[G] [C] [D]
[G] [C] [D]

Pre-Chorus:
[Em]  I'm not sure about a 
[D6]life after this
God k[Cmaj7]nows I've never been a 
sp[Bm7]iritual man
[Cmaj7]  Baptized by the [Bm]fire, 
I wade into the [A]river
That runs to the [D]promised [D6]lan[Dm]d

Chorus:
[D7] In the middle of the [G]night

I go walking in my sleep
Through the [G7]desert of [C]truth
To the river so [D]deep
We all end [D7]in the [G]ocean 
(end in the [Am7/G]o-[G]cean)
We all start in the streams 
(start  [Am7/G]in  the[G] streams)
We're all ca[G7]rried [C]along
[Cmaj7]By the river of [D]dreams
In the middle of the [G]night
