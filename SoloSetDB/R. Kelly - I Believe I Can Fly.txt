Verse:
[C]I used to think that i could not go[Fm]on
[C]And life was nothing but an awful s[Fm]ong
[C]But now I know the meaning of true [Fm]love
[C]I'm kneeling on the everlasting li[Fm]nes

Pre-Chorus:
If I can [Am]see it
Then I can [Fm]do it
If I just be[Am]lieve it
There's nothing t[G]o it

Chorus:
I believe i can [C]fly
I believe i can t[Am7]ouch the sky
I think about it every n[Dm]ight and day
Spread my wings and [G]fly away

I believe I can so[Am]ar
I see me running through that[Fm]open door
I believe I can[C]fly
I believe I can [Fm]fly
I believe I can f[Am]ly

Oh...

Verse:
See I [C]was on the verge of break[Fm]ing out
Sometim[C]es silence can seem so [Fm]loud
There a[C]re miracles in life i mus[Fm]t achieve
But fi[C]rst I know it starts ins[Fm]ide of me oh oh

Pre-Chorus:
If I can [Am]see it
Then I can [Fm]do it
If I just be[Am]lieve it
There's nothing t[G]o it

Chorus:
I believe i can [C]fly
I believe i can t[Am7]ouch the sky
I think about it every n[Dm]ight and day
Spread my wings and [G]fly away
I believe I can so[Am]ar
I see me running through that[Fm]open door
I believe I can[C]fly
I believe I can [Fm]fly
I believe I can f[Am]ly

Oh...
