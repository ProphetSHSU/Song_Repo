Intro:
[D][Em][D][Em]

Verse:
[D]Angels smoking cigarettes on [Em]rooftops in fishnets in the
[D]Morning with the moon still [Em]glowing
And [D]here comes Jesus in an Astrovan [Em]rolling down the strip again
He's [D]stoned while Jerry [G]plays

Chorus:
He said [D]life ain't ever what it seems
These [Em]dreams are more than paper things
But [D]it's alright mama you're afraid
[Em]I'll be poor along the way
But [D]I don't wanna see those tears again
You know, [Em]Jesus drives an Astrovan [D]
Yes, he [Em]does (I say, "[D]whooooo[Em]ooo")

Verse:
And [D]in my heart there's a holy ghost [Em]writhing on the floor from an overdose
You know the [D]best ones never come [Em]down
So if[D] I love at the tip of my toes [Em]reaching out for the great unknown
Every [D]addict has il[Em]lusions

Chorus:
[D]Life ain't ever what it seems
These [Em]dreams are more than paper things
And [D]it's alright mama you're afraid
[Em]I'll be poor along the way
But [D]I don't wanna see those tears again
You know [Em]Jesus drives an Astrovan[D]
Yes, he [Em]does (I say, "[D]whooooo[Em]ooo)
[D]     (it's true.[Em].. yeah)[D][Em]

Bridge:
And [D]when I see those angels on the [G]roof I know I've made it when my
[D]Doobie smoking Jesus puts my [G]name up on his guestlist
He said son you're [D]famous in heaven
Maybe you're [G]famous in heaven
And maybe there [D]is no heaven
And maybe we're [Em]all along together now
And [D]I don't wanna see those tears again
You know [Em]Jesus drives an Astrovan[D][Em][D][Em]

Outro:
[D]    D  [Em]       [D]    [Em]
And I don't wanna see those tears again
You know [Em]Jesus drives an Astrovan
