Verse:
[B7]   [E] I [E]hear the train a comin',
It's rolling round the bend.
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when.
I'm [A]stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on.
[E] But that [B7]train keeps a rollin' on down to San An[E]ton.

{c:JAKE SING}
Verse:
When I[E]was just a baby my mama told me,
"Son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns."
But I [A]shot a man in Reno just to watch him[E]die.
When I [B7]hear that whistle blowing I hang my head and [E]cry.

{c:LISA SING}
Verse:
[E]  [A]  [E]  [B7]   [E]  I[E]bet there's rich folks eating from a fancy dining car.
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars.
Well I [A]know I had it coming, I know I can't be[E]free,
But those [B7]people keep a movin',
And that's what tortures [E]me.

Solo:
[E]  [A]  [E]  [B7]   [E]  Well if they'd[E]free me from his prison,

{c:JAKE SING}
Verse:
If that railroad train was mine,
I bet I'd move it all a little farther down the line.
Far[A]  from Folsom prison, that's where I want to[E]stay,
And I'd [B7]let that lonesome whistle blow my blues a[E]way.
