Intro:  
[Am][Dm][E][F][G]

[Am][Dm][E][F][G]

[A]You could never know[D]what it's like.
Your [E]blood like winter freezes just [A]like ice.
And [Gbm]there's a cold lonely light that shines from y[Bm]ou.
You[D]'ll wind up like the wreck y[E]ou hide behind that mas[A]k  you use.

And d[A]id you think this fool could never win?[D]
Well lo[E]ok at me, I'm coming back ag[A]ain.
I got a t[Gbm]aste of love in a simple wa[Bm]y.

[D][E]

A[A]nd if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away.

Don't you know I'm st[Bbm7]ill standi[Am]ng better than I ever did.[Em7]
Looking like a true s[Dm7]urvivor, feeling like a little kid[Fmaj7].[G]
[Am7]I'm stil[Am]l standing after [Em7]all this time.
Picking up the pieces [Dm7]of my life without you on my mind.[E7]

I'm still st[Am]anding.  ye[Dm7]ah yeah yeah![E7]
I'm still st[Am]anding.  ye[Dm7]ah yeah yeah![E7][F][G]

Once I n[A]ever could hope to wi[D]n.
You sta[E]rting down the road leaving me again.[A]
The t[Gbm]hreats you made were meant to c[Bm]ut me down.
And i[D]f our love was just a[E] circus you'd be a clown  [A]by now.

Don't y[Bbm7]ou know I'[Am]m still standing better tha[Em7]n I ever did.
Looking like a true s[Dm7]urvivor, feeling like a little kid[Fmaj7].[G]

Picking up the pieces [Dm7]of my life without you on my mind.[E7]
