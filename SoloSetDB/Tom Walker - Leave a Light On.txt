Verse 1:
The se[Dm]cond someone mentioned 
you were all alone
I could feel[Bb]  the trouble 
coursin' through your veins

Now I know,[F] it's got ahold[C]

Just a phone[Dm] call left unanswered, 
had me sparkin' up
These ci[Bb]garettes won't stop me 
wonderin' where you are
Don't let [F]go, keep a[C]hold

Pre-Chorus:
If you look[Dm]  into the distance, 
there's a house up on the hill
Gui[Bb]din' like a lighthouse
To a place where you'll be safe 
to feel our [F]grace
'Cause we've all made mistakes
If you've lost your way [C]


Chorus:
I will leave the light on [Dm][Bb]
I will leave the light on [F][C]
I will leave the light on [Dm][Bb]
I will leave the light on [F][C]

Verse 2:
 Tell[Dm]  me what's been happenin', what's been on your mind
Late[Bb]ly you've been searchin' for a darker place
To [F]hide, that's al[C]right
But if you car[Dm]ry on abusing, you'll be robbed from us
I[Bb]  refuse to lose another friend to drugs
Just come [F]home, don't let [C]go

Pre-Chorus:
If you look[Dm]  into the distance, there's a house up on the hill
Gui[Bb]din' like a lighthouse
To a place where you'll be safe to feel our [F]grace
'Cause we've all made mistakes
If you've lost your way[C]


Chorus:
I will leave the light on [Dm] [Bb]
I will leave the light on [F][C]
I will leave the light on [Dm][Bb]
I will leave the light on [F][C]
I will leave the light on

Interlude:
If you [Dm]look into the distance, 
there's a house up on the hill
Gui[Bb]din' like a lighthouse
To a place where you'll be 
safe to feel our [F]grace
'Cause we've all made mistakes
If you've lost your way[C]

I will leave the light on
And I [Dm]know you're down and out now, 
but I need you to be brave
Hi[Bb]din' from the truth 
ain't gonna make this all okay
I see your [F]pain; 
if you don't feel our grace
And you've lost your way[C]
Well, I will leave the light on[Dm]

Outro:
[Bb]
I will leave the light on[F]
[C] 'Cause I will leave the light on
