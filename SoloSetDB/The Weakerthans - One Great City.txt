[D/F#][C][G]

Verse:
[D/F#]  Late afternoon, a[C]nother day is nearly done[G]
[D/F#]  A darker grey is [C]breaking through a lighter one[G]
[D/F#]  A thousand sharpened [C]elbows in the underground[G]
[D/F#]  That hollow hurried[C]sound

Chorus:
[Em]Feet on [D/F#]polished [C]floor
And [Em]in the [D/F#]dollar [C]store
The [Em]clerk is [D/F#]closing [A]up
And counting loonies trying not to [C]say
I hate [G]Winnipeg

Verse:
[D/F#]   The driver checks the [C]mirror seven minutes late[G]
[D/F#]   The crowded riders' [C]restlessness enunciates[G]
[D/F#]   The Guess Who sucked, the [C]Jets were lousy anyway[G]
[D/F#]The same route everyd[C]ay

Chorus:
And [Em]in the [D/F#]turning [C]lane
[Em]Someone's [D/F#]stalled a[C]gain
He's [Em]talking [D/F#]to him[A]self
And hears the price of gas repeat his [C]phrase
I hate [G]Winnipeg

Break:

[D/F#][C][G]
[D/F#][C]

Chorus:
And [Em]up a[D/F#]bove us [C]all
[Em]Leaning [D/F#]into [C]sky
Our [Em]golden [D/F#]business [C]boy
Will [Em]watch the [D/F#]North End [C]die
And [Em]sing, “I [D/F#]love this [A]town”
Then let his arcing wrecking ball [C]proclaim

[C]I       [D/F#]Hate        [G]Winnipeg

[G]
