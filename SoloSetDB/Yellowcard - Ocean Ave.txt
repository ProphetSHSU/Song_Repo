Intro:
[E5] [F#5] [D5]

Verse 1:
[E5]  There's a place off 
[F#5]Ocean Avenue[D5]
Where I used to sit and talk with you[E5]
We were both six[F#5]teen and 
it felt so right[D5]
Sleeping all day, staying up all[E5]  
night[F#5]

Pre-Chorus:
[D5]  staying up all[E5]  night[F#5][D5]

Verse 2:
[E5]  There's a place on the 
[F#5]corner of Cherry Street[D5]
We would walk on the beach in our bare feet[E5]
We were both eigh[F#5]teen and 
it felt so right[D5]
Sleeping all day, staying up all[E5]  
night[F#5]

Pre-Chorus:
[D5]  staying up all[E5]  night[F#5]

Chorus:
[D5]  If I could [E5]find you now[F#5]
things would get [D5]better
We could [E5]leave this town[F#5]
and run for[D5]ever
Let your [E5]waves crash down[F#5]
on me and [D5]take me away

Pre-Verse:
[E5] [F#5] [D5]

Verse 3:
[E5]  There's a piece of you[F#5]
that's here with me
[D5]  It's everywhere I go, 
it's everything I see[E5]
When I sleep, I [F#5]dream 
and it gets me by[D5]
I can make believe that you're here[E5]
tonight[F#5]

Pre-Chorus:
[D5]  That you're here[E5]
tonight[F#5]

Chorus:
[D5]  If I could [E5]find you now[F#5]
things would get [D5]better
We could [E5]leave this town[F#5]
and run for[D5]ever
I know some[E5]where, somehow[F#5]
we'll be to[D5]gether
Let your [E5]waves crash down[F#5]
on me and [D5]take me away

Interlude:
[C#5] [D5] [C#5] [D5]

Bridge:
[A5]  I remember the look in your eyes
[F#5]   When I told you that this was goodbye
[E5]  You were begging me not tonight
Not here,[D5]  not now
[A5]  We're looking up at the same night sky
[F#5]   And keep pretending the sun will not rise
[E5]  Be together for one more night
Somewhere,[D5]  somehow

Chorus:
If I could [E5]find you now[F#5]
things would get [D5]better
We could [E5]leave this town[F#5]
and run for[D5]ever
I know some[E5]where, somehow[F#5]
we'll be to[D5]gether
Let your [E5]waves crash down[F#5]
on me and [D5]take me away
