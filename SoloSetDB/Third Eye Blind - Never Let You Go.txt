I [D]never let you [G]go
I [D]never let [G]you go
I [D]never let you

Chorus:
[D]Turn a[A]round, our [G]back on each [A]other

Verse:
[D]You say that I've [G]changed
Well [D]maybe I [G]did
But [D]even if I [G]changed
What's [D]wrong with [G]it

I [D]never let [G]you go
I [D]never let you [G]go
I [D]never let [G]you go
I [D]never let you

Bridge:
And [D]our [A]friends are [G]gone and [A]gone
And [D]all the [A]time moves [G]on and [A]on
And [D]all I [A]know is it's [G]wrong, it's [A]wrong
And [D]all I [A]know it's [G]wrong, it's [A]wrong,
It's [D]wrong, it's [A]wrong

Verse:
If there's a [D]reason, it's lost on [G]me
Maybe we'll [D]be friends, I guess we'll [G]see

I [D]never let [G]you go
I [D]never let you

[D]Good i[A]dea, break a [G]promise to your [A]mother

[D]Turn a[A]round, our [G]back on each [A]other
That's a [D]good i[A]dea, break a [G]promise to your [A]mother
[D]Turn a[A]round your [G]back on each [A]other
What a [D]good i[A]dea…[G][A]

Outro:
I remember the [D]stupid things, the [G]mood rings,
The [D]bracelets and the [G]beads
Nickels and [D]dimes, yours and [G]mine,

Did you [D]cash in all your [G]dreams
You don't [D]dream for [G]me, no (goodbye, goodbye)
You don't [G]dream for [G]me, no
But I still [D]feel you pulse like [G]sonar
From the [D]days in the [G]waves
That [D]girl is like a [G]sunburn
[D]I would like to [G]say
The [D]girl is like a [G]sunburn
[D]I would like to [G]say
She's [D]like a sun[G]burn
She's [D]like a sun[G]burn
