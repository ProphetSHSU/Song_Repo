Intro:
[Em]

 
 
Verse 1:
Well, [Em]I had me a boy, turned him into a man
I showed him all the things that he didn't understand
Whoa,[B7]  and then I let him go[Em]
Now, there's [Em]one in California who's been cursing my name
'Cause I found me a better lover in the UK
Hey, hey,[B7]  until I made my geta[Em]way

 
 
Pre-Chorus:
{c:(N.C.)}
[Em]One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

 
 
Chorus:
[G]Ex's and the [D]oh, oh, oh's they haunt[Em]me
Like [B]ghosts they want[G] me to make 'em [D]all
They [Am]won't let [C]go
Ex's and [Em]oh’s

Verse 2:
I [Em]had a summer lover down in New Orleans
Kept him warm in the winter, left him frozen in the spring
My, my,[B7]  how the seasons go by[Em]
[Em]I get high, and I love to get low
So the hearts keep breaking, and the heads just roll
You know[B7]  that's how the story goes[Em]

 
 
Pre-Chorus:
[Em]One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
'Cause I'm the best baby that they never gotta keep
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

 
 
Chorus:
[G]Ex's and the [D]oh, oh, oh's they haunt[Em]me
Like [B]ghosts they want[G] me to make 'em [D]all
They [Am]won't let [C]go
My ex[G]'s and the [D]oh, oh, oh's they haunt[Em]me
Like [B]ghosts they want[G] me to make 'em [D]all
They [Am]won't let [C]go
Ex's and [Em]oh’s[B7][Em]

Solo:
[Em] […?]

Pre-Chorus:
[Em]One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
Climbing over mountains and asailing over seas
One, two, three, they gonna run back to me
They always wanna come, but they never wanna leave

Chorus:
My ex[G]'s and the [D]oh, oh, oh's they haunt[Em]me
Like [B]ghosts they want[G] me to make 'em [D]all
They [Am]won't let [C]go
My ex[G]'s and the [D]oh, oh, oh's they haunt[Em]me
Like [B]ghosts they want[G] me to make 'em [D]all
They [Am]won't let [C]go
Ex's and [Em]oh's
