[C]Games, changes and [G]fears
When will they [Dm]go from here
When [F]will they stop
I believe that [C]fate has brought us [G]here
And we should be [Dm]together babe
But [F]we're not[G]

[F]I play it off bit I'm [Em]dreaming of you
[F]I'll keep my cool but I'm [G]fiendin’

I try to say [C]goodbye and I choke
Try to walk a[G]way but I stumble
Though I try to [Dm]hide it, it's clear
My world [F]crumbles when you are [G]not near
Good[C]bye and I choke
Try to walk [G]away and I stumble
Though I try to [Dm]hide it, it's clear
My world [F]crumbles when you are [G]not near

[C]I may appear to be [G]free
But I'm just a [Dm]prisoner of your [F]love
I may seem [C]alright and smile when you [G]leave
But my smiles are [Dm]just a front, just a [F]front

[F]I play it off bit I'm [Em]dreaming of you
[F]I'll keep my cool but I'm [G]fiendin’

I try to say [C]goodbye and I choke
Try to walk a[G]way but I stumble
Though I try to [Dm]hide it, it's clear
My world [F]crumbles when you are [G]not near

Good[C]bye and I choke
Try to walk [G]away and I stumble
Though I try to [Dm]hide it, it's clear
My world [F]crumbles when you are [G]not near

[Eb]Here is my c[Gm]onfession
May I be your pos - [Eb]session?
Boy I need your [Dm]touch
Your love kisses and [Bb7]such
With all my might I [Am]try
But this I can't [Dm]deny
[G]Deny

[F]I play it off bit I'm [Em]dreaming of you
[Dm]I'll keep my cool but I'm [G]fiendin’

I [Ab]try to say good - [Db]bye and I choke
Try to walk [Ab]away but I stumble
Though I try to [Ebm]hide it, it's clear
My world [Gb]crumbles when you are n[Ab]ot near

Good - [Db]bye and I choke
Try to walk [Ab]away but I stumble
Though I try to [Ebm]hide it, it's clear
My world [Gb]crumbles when you are n[Ab]ot near
Good - [Db]bye and I choke
Try to walk [Ab]away but I stumble
Though I try to [Ebm]hide it, it's clear
My world [Gb]crumbles when you are n[Ab]ot near
