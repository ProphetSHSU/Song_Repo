VERSE:

[G]  [A]It's alright
[G]  [A]There comes a time
[G]  [A]Got no patience
[G]   To s[A]earch for peace of mind

[G]  [A]Laying' low
[G]  [A]Want to take it slow
[G]  [A]No more hiding
[G]Or dis[A]guising truths I've sold

CHORUS:

[F]  Every[G]day it's something
[A]Hits me all so cold
[F]Find me sittin' [G]by myself
No ex[D]cuses, then I know

VERSE:

[G]  [A]It's okay
[G]  [A]Had a bad day
[G]  [A]  Hands are bruise[G]d from
[A]Breaking rocks all day

[G]  [A]Drained and blue
[G]  [A]I bleed for you
[G]  [A]You think it's funny
[G]Well you're d[A]rowning in it too

[CHORUS:]

[F]  Every[G]day it's something
[A]Hits me all so cold
[F]Find me sittin' [G]by myself
No ex[D]cuses, then I know

VERSE:

[G]  [A]Yeah, it's fine
[G]  [A]We'll walk down the line
[G]  [A]Leave our rain
[G]A cold [A]trade for warm sunshine

[G]  [A]You're my friend
[G]  [A]I will defend
[G]  [A]And if we change
[G]Well I l[A]ove you anyway

CHORUS:

[F]  Every[G]day it's something
[A]Hits me all so cold
[F]Find me sittin' [G]by myself
No ex[D]cuses, then I know
