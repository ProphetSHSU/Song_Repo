Verse:
[Am]  On a dark desert highway,[E7]cool wind in my hair
[G]  Warm smell of colitas[D]rising up through the air
[F]  Up ahead in the distance,[C]I saw a shimmering light
[Dm]My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
[E]I had to stop for the night

[Am]  There she stood in the doorway;[E7]I heard the mission bell
[G]And I was thinking to myself
This could be [D]heaven or this could be hell
[F]  Then she lit up a candle,[C]and she showed me the way
[Dm]There were voices down the corridor,
[E]I thought I heard them say…

Chorus:
[F]  Welcome to the Hotel Cali[C]fornia.
Such a [E7]lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a [Am]lovely face
[F]Plenty of room at the Hotel Cali[C]fornia
Any [Dm]time of year, (any time of year) You can [E]find it here

Verse:
[Am] Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, [E7]She got the Mercedes bends
[G] She got a lot of pretty pretty boys [D]she calls friends
[F]  How they danced in the courtyard, [C]sweet summer sweat
[Dm]  Some dance to remember,[E]some dance to forget
[Am]  So I called up the captain;[E7]Please bring me my wine (he said)
[G] We haven't had that spirit here since[D]1969
[F]  and still those voices are calling from [C]far away
[Dm]Wake you up in the middle of the night
[E]Just to hear them say…

Chorus:
[F] Welcome to the Hotel Cali[C]fornia.
Such a [E7]lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a [Am]lovely face
They're [F]livin' it up at the Hotel Cali[C]fornia
What a [Dm]nice surprise, (what a nice surprise) Bring your [E]alibis

Verse:
[Am]   Mirrors on the ceiling;[E7]the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
[G]  We are all just prisoners here,[D]of our own device
[F]  and in the master's chambers,[C]they gathered for the feast
[Dm]They stab it with their steely knives but they
[E]just can't kill the beast

[Am]   Last thing I remember, I was[E7]running for the door
[G]  I had to find the passage back to the [D]place I was before
[F]  "Relax" said the night man; we are[C]programmed to receive
[Dm]You can check out any time you like
[E7]But you can never leave...
