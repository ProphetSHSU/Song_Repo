Verse:
[D]The first thing I remember [G]know-in'
was a [D]lonesome whist-le [G]blow-in,
And a [D]young-on's  dream of [G]grow-in up to [A]ride,
On a [D]freight train leav-in [G]town,
not [D]know-in where I'm [G]bound,
And no [D]one could change my [A]mind, but Ma-ma [D]tried.

[D]One and on-ly reb-el [G]child,
From a [D]fam-ily meek and [G]mild,
My [D]ma-ma seemed to [G]know what lay in [A]store,
Spite a[D]ll my Sun-day [G]learn-in'
towards the [D]bad I kept on [G]turn-in,
Til [D]Ma-ma could-n't [A]hold me an-y-[D]more.

Chorus:
[D]And I turned twenty-one in pris-on do-in [G]life with-out
pa-[D]role, [G]No one could steer [D]me right but Ma-[A]ma tried,
Mama tried. Ma-ma [D]tried to raise me bet-ter,  but her
[G]plead-ing I [D]de-nied, That leaves only me to [A]blame,
cause Ma-ma [D]tried.

Verse:
[D]Dear ol' Dad-dy, rest his [G]soul,
left my [D]mom a heav-y [G]load,
She [D]tried so very [G]hard to fill his [A]shoes,
Work-in [D]hou-rs with-out [G]rest,
Want-ed [D]me to have the [G]best,
She [D]tried to raise me [A]right but I re-[D]fused

Chorus:
[D]And I turned twenty-one in prison do-in [G]life with-out
pa-[D]role, No [G]one could steer me [D]right but Ma-ma [A]tried,
Mama tried. Ma-ma [D]tried to raise me bet-ter,  but her
[G]plead-ing I [D]de-nied,
That leaves only me to [A]blame cause Ma-ma tried..
