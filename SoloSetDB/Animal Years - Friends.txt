I was singing on the ro[G]ad, Many [C]years [G]ago
I was o[C]n my o[G]wn
So [C]far from h[G]ome
Bitter da[G]ys
When I felt like I c[C]ould not [G]win
When I [C]lost it [G]all, and I n[D]eeded a [G]friend

W[G]hoa, [C]wh[G]oa, oh[C], oh[G], a[D]

Well I had up and g[G]one
When I got [C]on my o[G]wn
Noth[D]ing l[G]ike the kid I [C]used to k[G]now
When I f[G]eel, because I'm a b[C]igger m[G]an
That I d[D]on't need y[G]ou and I[C] don't need [G]them

[G]    Sail away, to the life we [C]had[G]
To the words we[C] said[G]
That we don't wa[D]nt to be grown ups
And we'll always bel[G]ieve
Till we never[C] pretend[G]
And at the end of th[C]e day, I still[G] got all of friends[D]
I still got all [C]of my friends[G]

I'm alone,[G] in a world unk[C]nown[G]
Thro[D]wn my hands up f[G]rom the constant blows[C][G]
So when you feel like y[G]ou're having a heart attach[C][G]
Because she breaks your h[D]eart and she won't[G] call back[C][G]

[G]    Sail away, to the life we h[C]ad[G]
To the words w[C]e said[G]
That we don't wa[D]nt to be grown ups
And we'll always be[G]lieve
Till we never [C]pretend[G]
And when my hearts on mend[C], I still got [G]all of friends[D]
I still got all [C]of my friends[G]

[G][G][C][C]

You need to understand[G]
I need to let you know
No matter where we'v[C]e been
No matter where we go
And when the time is rig[G]ht
You'll feel it in your bones
You'll start to see th[C]e light
A place you used to know
We need to make amen[Em]ds
Because the space has gr[D]own
So let's all come home, home, [C]home home
[G]     Sail away, to the life we[C] had[G]
To the words w[C]e said[G]
That we don't w[D]ant to be grown ups
And we'll always be[G]lieve
Till we never[C] pretend[G]
And at the end of t[C]he day, I still [G]got all of friends[D]
I'll tell you where I go[G]

[G]Sail away, to the life we [C]had[G]
To the words[C] we said[G]
That we don't wa[D]nt to be grown ups
And we'll always b[G]elieve
Till we neve[C]r pretend[G]
And at the end of t[C]he day, I still[G] got all of friends[D]
I still got all[C] of my friends[G]
