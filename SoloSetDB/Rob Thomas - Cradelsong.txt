Vers 1:
[A]Everybody's got a different story
Everybody wanna give their selves a[D]way

If we can keep ourselves a half a world a[D]way
Ah honey we'll be [A]ok

This cradle [A]song                All night long

Vers 2:
[A]Everybody's got their own opinion
Everybody's got a place where they be[D]long

I don't want to be the ghost that you can't [D]shake
I want to be the real[A]thing

[A]No one said that we were victims honey
No one said we had to keep the things we [D]get
And there ain't no [A]regrets
And all our friends, they moved to Hollywood
    But we ain't that desperate [D]yet, oh no
ain't nothing like the [A]real thing
