Intro:
[A][E][D]
[A][E][D]

Verse:
[A]She's cold and she's cruel but she kn[E]ows what she's[D] doing[A][E][D]
[A]She pushed me in the pool at our hi[E]gh school reu[D]nion[A][E][D]
[A]She laughs at my dreams, but I dre[E]am about her la[D]ughter[A][E][D]
[A]Strange as it seems, she's the o[E]ne I'm a[D]fter[E][(one][strum)][D]

Chorus:
Cause she's [A]bittersw[E]eet
She knocks me [F#m]off my fe[D]et
And I ca[A]n't help myself
I don't want [E]anyone e[D]lse
She's a [A]myste[E]ry
She's too [F#m]much for [D]me
But I k[A]eep coming b[E]ack for [Bm]more
She's j[F#m]ust the girl I'm l[D]ooking for[A]

Verse:
[A]She can't keep a secret for m[E]ore than an ho[D]ur[A][E][D]
[A]She runs on one hundred proof [E]attitude p[D]ower[A][E][D]
[A]And the more she ignores me the m[E]ore I ad[D]ore her[A][E][D]
[A]What can I do?  I'd do a[E]nything f[D]or her[E][(one][strum)][D]

But I k[A]eep coming b[E]ack for [Bm]more
She's j[F#m]ust the girl I'm l[D]ooking for[A]

Bridge:
[F#m]The way she sees it's me[A]
On her caller [Bm]ID
She won't pick up the p[E]hone
She'd rather [F?]be alon[F#]e
But I can't give up just y[A]et
Cause every word she's ever [Bm]said
Is still r[F#m]inging in my h[D]ead
Still ringing in [G]my head[D]

Verse:
[A]She's cold and she's cruel but she kn[E]ows what she's[D] doing[A][E][D]
[A]Knows just what to say so my wh[E]ole day is r[D]uined[E][D]
