Verse:
[D]So this is what you meant when you said that you were spent?
[A]And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit right to the [Bm]top,
Do[Bm]n't hold back
[G]Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

Pre-Chorus:
[D]I don't ever want to let you down[A]
I don't ever want to leave this town[Bm]
'Cause after [G]all
[G]This city never sleeps at night...

Chorus:
[D]It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit b[Bm]igger, but then,
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I [Em]was
Now don't you und[G]erstand
That I'm never changing who I am?

Instrumental:
[D][A][Bm][G]

Verse:
[D]So this is where you fell, and I am left to sell
[A]the path that heaven runs through miles of clouded hell,
right to the [Bm]top
[Bm]Don't look back
[G]Turning to rags and give the commodities a rain check

Pre-Chorus:
[D]I don't ever want to let you down
[A]I don't ever want to leave this t[Bm]own
'Cause after a[G]ll
[G]This city never sleeps at night...

Chorus:
[D]It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bi[Bm]gger, but then,
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I w[Em]as
Now don't you und[G]erstand
[G]That I'm never changing who I am?
[D]It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bi[Bm]gger, but then,
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I w[Em]as
Now don't you und[G]erstand
[G]That I'm never changing who I am?

Bridge:
[Bm]This road never looked so lo[A]nely,
This house doesn't burn down s[G]lowly,
[Em]to ashes, to a[G]shes...

Chorus:
[Bm]It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit b[A]igger, but then,
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I w[G]as
[Em]Now don't you unde[G]rstand
[G]That I'm never changing who I am?
[Bm]It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit b[A]igger, but then,
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I w[G]as
[Em]Now don't you unde[G]rstand
[G]That I'm never changing who I am?
