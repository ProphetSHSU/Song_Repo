G                    G/F#
If I could trace the lines that ran
  Em7                       G/F#
Between your smile and your sleight of hand
    G                  G/F#            Em7     G/F#
I'd guess that you put something up my sleeve
    G           G/F#
Now everytime I see your face
    Em7             G/F#
The bells ring in a far off place
       G               G/F#            Em7  G/F#
We can find each other this was I believe

 
From the hills and up behind
My town is naked from the horizon down
The curvature is pressed against the raise

We walked up in the fields below alone
And the silence fell just like a stone
That got lost in the wild blue and gravel gray

 
G/B  G/A  G/F#  G
Come and  find  me, now
G/B  G/A  G/F#  G       G/F# Em7 G/F#
Come and  find  me, now  
 

 
Though I'm here in this far off place
My air is not your time and space
I draw you close with every breath
You don't know it's right untill wrong
You don't know it's your's untill it's gone
I didn't know that it was home until you up and left

 
Come and find me, now
Come and fine me, now

 
So I keep you in a flower vase
With your fatalism and your crooked face
With the daisies and the violet blockades
And I keep me in a vacant lot
In the ivy and forget-me-nots
Hoping you will come and untangle me one of these days

 
Come and find me, now
Come and fine me, now
