Intro:
[C][G][Am][F]

Verse:
[C]  I'm going under and this [G]time I fear there's no one to s[Am]ave me[F]
[C]  This all or nothing really [G]got a way of driving me c[Am]razy[F]
I need somebody to he[C]al, somebody to kn[G]ow, somebody to h[Am]ave, somebody to h[F]old
It's easy to s[C]ay, but it's never the [G]same
I guess I kinda [Am]liked the way you numbed all the p[F]ain

Chorus:
Now the day blee[C]ds into nightf[G]all
And you're not he[Am]re to get me through it all[F]
I let my guard dow[C]n, and then you pulled the [G]rug
I was getting kinda [Am]used to being someone you l[F]oved

Verse:
[C]   I'm going under and this t[G]ime I fear there's no one to tur[Am]n to[F]
[C]  This all or nothing way of [G]lovin' got me sleepin' witho[Am]ut you[F]
Now, I need somebody to k[C]now, somebody to h[G]eal, somebody to [Am]have, just to know how it f[F]eels
It's easy to s[C]ay, but it's never the [G]same
I guess I kinda [Am]liked the way you helped me esc[F]ape

Chorus:
Now the day ble[C]eds into nightfal[G]l
And you're not he[Am]re to get me through it al[F]l
I let my guard dow[C]n, and then you pulled the [G]rug
I was getting kinda [Am]used to being someone you l[F]oved

Bridge:
And [Dm]I tend to clo[Am]se my eyes when it h[G]urts sometimes
I fall int[Am]o your a[Dm]rms
I'll be s[Am]afe in your sound 'til I co[G]me back around

Chorus:
N.C.                 C                G
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not he[Am]re to get me through it al[F]l
I let my guard dow[C]n, and then you pulled the [G]rug
I was getting kinda [Am]used to being someone you l[F]oved

But now the day blee[C]ds into nightfall[G]
And you're not he[Am]re to get me through it al[F]l
I let my guard dow[C]n, and then you pulled the [G]rug
I was getting kinda [Am]used to being someone you l[F]oved

Outro:
I let my guard dow[C]n, and then you pulled the ru[G]g
I was getting kinda [Am]used to being someone you l[F]oved[C]
