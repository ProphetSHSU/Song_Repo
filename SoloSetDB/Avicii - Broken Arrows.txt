Verse:
[Em]You stripped your [C]love down to the [G]wire
[Em]Fire shy and [C]cold alone out[G]side[D]
[Em]You stripped it [C]right down to the [G]wire
But [Em]I see you be[C]hind those tired [G]eyes[D]

Pre-Chorus:
Now as you [Em]wade through [C]shadows that [G]live in your heart
You'll find the[Em]  light that[C] leads [G]home[D]
Cause I see [Em]you for [C]you and your [G]beautiful stars
So take my[Em]  hand, [C]don't let [G]go[D]

Chorus:
Cause it's [Em]not[C] too late, it's[G]not too late
[Em]I, I see the [C]hope in your [G]heart[D]
And [Em]somet[C]imes you lose it, [G]sometimes you're shooting
[Em]Broken [C]arrows in the [G]dark[D]
    N.C.                
But I, I see the hope in your heart

Verse:
[Em]  I've seen the [C]darkness in the [G]light
[Em]  The kind of blue that [C]leaves you lost and [G]blind[D]
[Em]  The only [C]thing that's black and [G]white
  Is that [Em]you don't have to [C]walk alone this [G]time[D]

Pre-Chorus:
We have to [Em]tear down [C]walls that [G]live in your heart
To find [Em]someone you[C] call [G]home[D]
Now you see [Em]me for [C]me and my b[G]eautiful scars
So take m[Em]y hand, [C]don't let [G]go[D]

Chorus:
Cause it's [Em]not[C] too late, it's[G]not too late
[Em]I, I see the [C]hope in your [G]heart[D]
And [Em]somet[C]imes you lose it, [G]sometimes you're shooting
[Em]Broken [C]arrows in the [G]dark[D]
