Intro:
[G#m] [Emaj7][F#][D#sus4][D#]

Verse:
[G#m]I took a page out of your favorite book
[Emaj7]You sold me lies just by the way you look
[F#]Taught me a language that I've never speak
Baby, [D#sus4]that  ain't for me, that, [D#]that ain't for me
[G#m]I dug my grave watchin' the way you move
[Emaj7]You took me higher than I ever flew, ooh
[F#]Too many times, gave you a second chance
Baby, [D#sus4]I'm   just a man, I'm, [D#]I'm just a man

Pre-Chorus:
[G#m]No more thinkin' about you late night
[Emaj7]No   more runnin' around with your friends now[F#]
Done pickin' up pieces of my
Soul[D#sus4]      up off the floor,[D#]  oh, oh[G#m]

Chorus:
I said I would die for you, baby
[Emaj7]     But I can't take this pain no more[F#]
I thought I was willin'
But tonight[D#sus4]      I saved my life[D#]when I showed you the door
[G#m]I don't wanna lose you, baby
[Emaj7]     But I can't play this gamÐµ no more[F#]
I thought it would kill me
But tonight[D#sus4]      I saved my lifÐµ[D#]when I showed you the door

Verse:
[G#m]You never thought this day would ever come
[Emaj7]But I looked you in the eyes and pulled the rug
[F#]You tried to take away my saniety
Baby, [D#sus4]that  ain't for me, that, [D#]that ain't for me

Pre-Chorus:
Oh, [G#m]no more thinkin' about you late night
[Emaj7]No   more runnin' around with your friends now[F#]
Done pickin' up pieces of my
Soul[D#sus4]      up off the floor,[D#]  oh, oh[G#m]

Chorus:
I said I would die for you, baby
[Emaj7]     But I can't take this pain no more[F#]
I thought I was willin'
But tonight[D#sus4]      I saved my life[D#]when I showed you the door
[G#m]I don't wanna lose you, baby
[Emaj7]     But I can't play this gamÐµ no more[F#]
I thought it would kill me
But tonight[D#sus4]      I saved my lifÐµ[D#]when I showed you the door

Post-Chorus:
[G#m]   When I showed you the door[Emaj7]
When I showed you the door[F#]
But tonight[D#sus4]      I saved my life[D#]

Chorus:
[G#m]I said I would die for you, baby
[Emaj7]     But I can't take this pain no more[F#]
I thought I was willin'
But tonight[D#sus4]      I saved my life[D#]when I showed you the door
[G#m]I don't wanna lose you, baby
[Emaj7]     But I can't play this gamÐµ no more[F#]
I thought it would kill me
But tonight[D#sus4]      I saved my lifÐµ[D#]when I showed you the door
