Intro:
[G][C][G][C][G][D][C][G]

Verse:
Looking[G] back on the[C] memory of the[D]dance we shared
Beneath the [G]stars above[D], for a [G]moment all the [C]world was right.
How could I[D] have known that you'd e[C/E]ver say goodb[D/F#]ye?

Chorus:
And [C]now, I'm glad I didn't [D]know the way it all would [Bm]end,
the way it all would [C]go.[D]
Our [C]lives, are better left to [D]chance. I could have missed the [Bm]pain
but I'd have had to [C]miss [D]the [G]dance

Verse:
Holding [G]you I held e[C]verything.  For a m[D]oment wasn't [G]I the king?[D]
But if I'd [G]only known how the [C]king would fall, hey [D]who's to say
you know I [C/E]might have changed it [D]all.

Chorus:
And [C]now, I'm glad I didn't [D]know the way it all would [Bm]end,
the way it all would [C]go.[D]
Our [C]lives, are better left to [D]chance. I could have missed the [Bm]pain
but I'd have had to [C]miss [D]the [G]dance

Yes my [C]life, it's better left to [D]chance.
I could have have missed the [Bm]pain,
but I'd have had to [C]miss [D]the [N.C.]dance.
