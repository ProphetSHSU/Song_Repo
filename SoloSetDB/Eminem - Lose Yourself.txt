Intro:
[Dm][C][Dm][Dm][C][Dm]
[Gm][Dm][A]

[Dm]Look
[Bb/D]If you had
[Dm]One shot
[Bb/D]Or one opportunity
[Dm]To seize everything you ever wanted
[Bb/D]In one moment
Would you [Dm]capture it
Or just [Bb/D]let it slip?
Yo

Verse:
His palms are [Dm]sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's [Bb/D]vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's [Dm]nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop [Bb/D]bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he [Dm]wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He o[Bb/D]pens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's cho[Dm]kin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run [Bb/D]out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap [Dm]back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh,[Bb/D]there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't[Dm]give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows[Bb/D]his whole back city's ropes
It don't matter, he's dope,[Dm]he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows,[Bb/D]when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when its
[Dm]Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He [Bb/D]better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

Chorus:
You better [Dm]lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own [Bb/D]it, you better never let it go
You only get one[Dm]shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This oppor[Bb/D]tunity comes once in a lifetime you better
[Dm]Lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own [Bb/D]it, you better never let it go
You only get one[Dm]shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This oppor[Bb/D]tunity comes once in a lifetime you better

Verse:
The [Dm]souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping
[Bb/D]This world is mine for the taking
Make me king,[Dm]as we move toward a, new world order
A [Bb/D]normal life is borin', but super stardom's [Dm]close to post mortem
It only grows harder, on[Bb/D]ly grows hotter
He blows us all over these hoes[Dm]is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known[Bb/D]as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows,[Dm]he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes[Bb/D]home and barely knows his own daughter
But [Dm]hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes[Bb/D]don't want him no more, he's cold product
They [Dm]moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove[Bb/D]and sold nada
So the soap opera is told[Dm]  and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the [Bb/D]beat goes on
Da da dumb da dumb da da

Chorus:
You better [Dm]lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own [Bb/D]it, you better never let it go
You only get one[Dm]shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This oppor[Bb/D]tunity comes once in a lifetime you better
[Dm]Lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own [Bb/D]it, you better never let it go
You only get one[Dm]shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This oppor[Bb/D]tunity comes once in a lifetime you better

Verse:
No more[Dm]games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this [Bb/D]motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was [Dm]playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been [Bb/D]chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I [Dm]kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next cipher
[Bb/D]Best believe somebody's payin' the pied piper
[Dm]All the pain inside amplified by the
[Bb/D]Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
[Dm]Five and I can't provide the right type of
[Bb/D]Life for my family 'cause man, these God damn food stamps[Dm]don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's [Bb/D]no  Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these [Dm]times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to [Bb/D]feed and water my seed, plus
See dishonor caught up [Dm]between bein' a father and a prima-donna
Baby [Bb/D]mama drama screamin' on and too much

Verse:
For me to want to [Dm]say in one spot, another jam or not
Has gotten [Bb/D]me  to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formu[Dm]late a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Suc[Bb/D]cess is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
[Dm]  Mom, I love you, but this trail has got to go, [Bb/D]I   cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I [Dm]go is my shot
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe [Bb/D]the only opportunity that I got

Chorus:
You better [Dm]lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own [Bb/D]it, you better never let it go
You only get one[Dm]shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This oppor[Bb/D]tunity comes once in a lifetime you better
[Dm]Lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own [Bb/D]it, you better never let it go
You only get one[Dm]shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This oppor[Bb/D]tunity comes once in a lifetime you better
