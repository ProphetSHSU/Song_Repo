Intro:
[G][G#dim7][Am7][D]

Verse:
Blame it [G]all on my roots, I [G#dim7]showed up in boots and [Am7]ruined your black tie affair
The l[D]ast one to know,     the [D]last one to show
I was the [G]last one you thought you'd see there
And I [G]saw the surprise and the [G#dim7]fear in his eyes when [Am7]I took his glass of champ[Cm]agne
[D]I toasted you, [D]said honey [D]we may be throu[D]gh [D]but you'll [D]never hear me [D]compl[D]ain

Chorus:
'Cause [G]I got friends in [G]low places where the [G]whiskey drowns and the [G]beer chases
My b[Am]lues away[Am] and I'll[D] be okay[D]
[G]I'm not big on [G]social graces, think I'll [G]slip on down to the [G]oasis
oh, [Am]I've got friends[D] in low pla[G]ces

Solo:
[G][G][G][G]

[Am][D][G][G]

Verse:
Wel[G]l, I guess I was wrong, [G#dim7]I just don't belong b[Am7]ut then, I've been there before
Every[D]thing's alright, I'll j[D]ust say goodnight
And I'll sh[G]ow myself to the door[G]
Hey, [G]I didn't mean to c[G#dim7]ause a big scene, just [Am7]give me an hour, an[Cm]d then
[D]I'll be as high[D] as that iv[D]ory tower that [D]you[D]’re livin’ [D]in[D][D]

Chorus:
'Cause [G]I got friends in [G]low places where the [G]whiskey drowns and the [G]beer chases
My b[Am]lues away[Am] and I'll[D] be okay[D]
[G]I'm not big on [G]social graces, think I'll [G]slip on down to the [G]oasis
oh, [Am]I've got friends[D] in low pla[G]ces

Verse:
I gu[G]ess I was wrong, I [G#dim7]just don't belong but t[Am7]hen, I've been there before
And everyth[D]ing's alright, I'll just s[D7]ay goodnight
And I'll sh[G]ow myself to the door

[G]I didn't mean to [G#dim7]cause a big scene just w[Am7]ait 'til I finish this g[Cm]lass
Then sw[D]eet little lady I'll he[D7]ad back to the bar and you can kiss my ass

(tab as before)
I [G]guess I was wrong, I [G#dim7]just don't belong but [Am7]then, I've been there before, and
Every[D]thing's alright, I'll j[D]ust say goodnight
