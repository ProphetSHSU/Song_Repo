Verse:
[Am]   Hello darkness, my old [G]friend,
I've come to talk with you [Am]again,
Because a vision soft[F]ly creep[C]ing,
Left its seeds while I [F]was slee[C]ping,
And the [F]vision that was planted in my [C]brain
Still remain[C/B]s[Am]
[C]Within the s[G]ound of s[Am]ilence.

Verse:
In restless dreams I wal[G]ked alone
Narrow streets of cobble[Am]stone,
'neath the halo of [F]a street [C]lamp,
I turned my collar to the [F]cold and [C]damp
When my [F]eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon [C]light
That split the night[C/B][Am]
A[C]nd touched the [G]sound of [Am]silence.

Verse:
And in the naked light I [G]saw
Ten thousand people, maybe [Am]more.
People talking with[F]out spea[C]king,
People hearing with[F]out liste[C]ning,
People writing [F]songs that voices never [C]share
And no one dar[C/B]ed[Am]
[C]Disturb the [G]sound of [Am]silence.

Verse:
Fools said I, you do not [G]know
Silence like a cancer [Am]grows.
Hear my words that I [F]might teach [C]you,
Take my arms that I [F]might reach [C]you.
But my [F]words like silent raindrops [C]fell[C/B],[Am]
And[C]echoed
In the [G]wells of [Am]silence

Verse:
And the people bowed and [G]prayed
To the neon God they [Am]made.
And the sign flashed out [F]its war[C]ning,
In the words that it w[F]as for[C]ming.
And the sign said, the [F]words of the prophets
Are written on the subway w[C]alls
And tenement [C]halls.[C/B][Am]
And whisp[C]er'd in the [G]sounds of [Am]silence.
