Verse:
[Em]Melt Antarctica, s[C]avin' Africa
[G]I failed algebra a[D]nd I misused some times
[Em]We're at war again, [C]save the world again
[G]You can all join in, [D]but you can't smoke inside

Verse:
[Em]You said "Take me home, I can't [C]stand this place
'Cause ther[G]e's too many hipsters and [D]I just can't relate"
[Em]You're my neon gypsy, [C]my desert rain
[G]You're my "Helter Skelter", oh [D]how can I explain that

Chorus:
[Em]You're the best I [C]ever h[G]ad
And I[D]'m trying not to [Em]get stuck [C]in my h[G]ead
But [D]I read t[Em]hat soda kills you and J[C]esus saves
On t[G]he bathroom wall wh[D]ere I saw your name
[Em]You're the best I e[C]ver h[G]ad
[D]I won't be the same

[Em][C][G][D]

Verse:
[Em]Night sky full of drones, [C]this neighborhood of clones
[G]I'm looking at the crowd and [D]they're staring at their phones
[Em]They groom the coast line here, [C]the sun will disappear (Oh God!)
[G]And maybe once a year, [D]I think they'll clean my car

Verse:
[Em]Caught my reflection, [C]drop the call
[G]I've been medicated with[D]cigarettes and alcohol
[Em]I got vertigo, no [C]I can't see straight

Chorus:
[Em]You're the best I [C]ever h[G]ad
And I[D]'m trying not to [Em]get stuck [C]in my h[G]ead
But [D]I think [Em]I dropped my wallet in S[C]anta Fe
Lost[G] the only picture I[D]had of you that day and
[Em]You're the best I e[C]ver h[G]ad
[D]I won't be the same

[Em]Hey West Virginia, [C]Hey North Dakota

[Em]Hey Massachusetts, H[C]ey Minnesota
[G]I think I love you, b[D]ut don't even know you
[Em]Hey Carolina, [C]Hey Oklahoma
[G]I think I love you, [D]but don't even know you
[Em]Hey Alabama, H[C]ey California
[G]I think I love you, [D]but don't even know you

Chorus:
[Em]You're the best I [C]ever h[G]ad (you're the best I ever had)
And I[D]'m trying not to [Em]get stuck [C]in my h[G]ead (get stuck in my head)
But [D]I passed[Em] the longest sign on the[C]interstate

[Em]Hey Massachusetts, H[C]ey Minnesota (you're the best I ever had)
[G]I think I love you, b[D]ut don't even know you (I[Em]won't be the same)
Yeah, I won't be the same
