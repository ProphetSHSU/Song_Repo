Verse:
[G]Once [Cadd9]upon a [Am]midnight [D]dearie
[G]I woke with somethin[Cadd9]g in my he[Am]ad[D]
I [G]couldn't es[Cadd9]cape the [Am]memo[D]ry
Of a p[G]hone call and of [Cadd9]what you sa[Am]id[D]
Like a g[G]ame show con[Cadd9]testant with a [Am]parting g[D]ift
I could [G]not belie[C]ve my e[Am]yes[D]
When I [G]saw through the [Cadd9]voice of a [Am]trusted f[D]riend
Who needs to [G]humor me an[Cadd9]d tell me [Am]lies[D]
Yeah h[G]umor me and [Cadd9]tell me l[Am]ies[D]
And [G]I'll lie [Cadd9]too and say[Am] I don't [D]mind
And [G]as we[Cadd9] seek so [Am]shall we f[D]ind
And [G]when you're feeling[Cadd9] open I'll s[Am]till be h[D]ere
But [G]not without a [Cadd9]certain degr[Am]ee of fe[D]ar
Of w[G]hat will[Cadd9] be with [Am]you and [D]me
I s[G]till can[Cadd9] see things h[Am]opefull[D]y

Chorus:
But [G]you[Cadd9][Am][D]
Why you wanna g[G]ive me a[Cadd9] run-aro[Am]und[D]
Is it a [G]sure-fire[Cadd9] way to s[Am]peed things [D]up
When [G]all it does is[Cadd9] sl    [Am]-    [D]ow me d[G]own[Cadd9][Am][D]

Verse:
And s[G]hake m[Cadd9]e and my c[Am]onfid[D]ence

About a g[G]reat man[Cadd9]y thing[Am]s[D]
But I've [G]been there[Cadd9] I can [Am]see it c[D]ower
Like a n[G]ervous magician[Cadd9] waiting in the w[Am]ings[D]
Of a [G]bad [Cadd9]play where the [Am]heroes are r[D]ight
And n[G]obody t[Cadd9]hinks or ex[Am]pects too m[D]uch
And H[G]ollywood's [Cadd9]calling for the [Am]movie r[D]ights
Singing hey b[G]abe let's [Cadd9]keep in t[Am]ouch[D]
Hey b[G]aby let[Cadd9]'s keep in[Am] touch[D]
But [G]I want more than a [Cadd9]touch I w[Am]ant you to reach [D]me
And s[G]how me all the [Cadd9]things no one [Am]else can s[D]ee
So w[G]hat you [Cadd9]feel becomes m[Am]ine as [D]well
And s[G]oon if we're [Cadd9]lucky we'd be un[Am]able to t[D]ell
What's yo[G]urs and [Cadd9]mine the f[Am]inshings f[D]ine
And it d[G]oesn't have to [Cadd9]rhyme so don't f[Am]eed me a l[D]ine

Chorus:
But [G]you[Cadd9][Am][D]
Why you wanna g[G]ive me a[Cadd9] run-aro[Am]und[D]
Is it a [G]sure-fire[Cadd9] way to s[Am]peed things [D]up
When [G]all it does is[Cadd9] sl    [Am]-    [D]ow me d[G]own[Cadd9][Am][D]

Verse:
Tra la la la la b[G]omba [Cadd9]dear this is the p[Am]ilot spe[D]aking
And I've g[G]ot some [Cadd9]news for y[Am]ou[D]

It seems my s[G]hip still s[Cadd9]tands no matter w[Am]hat you d[D]rop
And there ain't a w[G]hole lot that[Cadd9] you can [Am]do[D]
Oh sure the b[G]anner may be [Cadd9]torn and w[Am]ind's gotten c[D]older
[G]  Perhaps I've [Cadd9]grown a little c[Am]ynical[D]
But I k[G]now no m[Cadd9]atter what the w[Am]aitress b[D]rings
I shall d[G]rink it and [Cadd9]always [Am]be ful[D]l
Yeah I will [G]drink it and [Cadd9]always [Am]be f[D]ull
Oh [G]I like [Cadd9]coffee, and[Am] I like t[D]ea
I'd like to [G]be able to[Cadd9] enter a f[Am]inal p[D]lea
I s[G]till got this [Cadd9]dream that you j[Am]ust can't s[D]hake
I l[G]ove you to the [Cadd9]point you can no [Am]longer t[D]ake
Well all r[G]ight, [Cadd9]okay, s[Am]o be that w[D]ay
I h[G]ope and [Cadd9]pray that there's so[Am]mething left to [D]say

Chorus:
But [G]you[Cadd9][Am][D]
Why you wanna g[G]ive me a[Cadd9] run-aro[Am]und[D]
Is it a [G]sure-fire[Cadd9] way to s[Am]peed things [D]up
When [G]all it does i[Cadd9]s slow me d[Am]own[D]
But [G]you[Cadd9][Am][D]
Why you wanna g[G]ive me a[Cadd9] run-aro[Am]und[D]
Is it a [G]sure-fire[Cadd9] way to s[Am]peed things [D]up
