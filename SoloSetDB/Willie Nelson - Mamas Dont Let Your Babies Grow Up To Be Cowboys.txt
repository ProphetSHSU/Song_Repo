Intro:
[D]

Verse:
[D]Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to [G]hold
[A7]They'd rather give you a song than diamonds or g[D]old
[D]Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levi's and [G]each night begins a new day
If you do[A7]n't understand him and he don't die young
He'll probably just ride a[D]way

Chorus:
[D]Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be [G]cowboys
Don't [A7]let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and [D]such
[D]Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be [G]cowboys
They'll [A7]never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they [D]love

Verse:
[E]Cowboys like smokey ol' pool rooms and clear mountain [A]mornings
[B7]Little warm puppies, and children, and girls of the ni[E]ght
[E]Them that don't know him won't like him and them that do [A]sometimes won't know how to take him
He ain't [B7]wrong, he's just different but his pride won't let him
Do the things to make you think he's [E]right

Chorus:
[E]Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be [A]cowboys
Don't [B7]let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and [E]such
[E]Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be [A]cowboys
They'll [B7]never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they [E]love
