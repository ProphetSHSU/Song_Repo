Verse:
Well I guess it would be ni[A]ce if I could touch your body
I know not every[D]body has got a body like y[A]ou
But I've got to think tw[A]ice before I give my heart away
And I know a[D]ll the games you play because I play them t[A]oo

Pre-Chorus:
Oh, but I [D]need some time off from [A]that emotion
[D]Time to pick my heart up off the fl[A]oor
Oh when that l[D]ove comes down with[A]out devo[F#m7]tion
Well it ta[Bm]kes a strong man baby but I'm sh[E]owing you the door

Chorus:
‘Cause I gotta have f[A]aith, I gotta have faith

Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith

I gotta have faith, faith, a-faith ah

Verse:
[A]BABY, I know you're asking me to stay
Say please, please, p[D]lease don't go away
You say I'm giving you the b[A]lues
[A]MAYBE, you mean every word you say
Can't help but t[D]hink of yesterday
And another who t[A]ied, me, down, to, lover boy rules

Pre-Chorus:
Be[D]fore this river b[A]ecomes an ocean
Be[D]fore you throw my heart back on the fl[A]oor
Oh-baby-I re[D]consider my f[A]oolish [F#m7]notion
Well I n[Bm]eed someone to hold me but I'll w[E]ait for something more

Chorus:
Yes I gotta have [A]faith, I gotta have faith

Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith

I gotta have faith, faith, a-faith ah

Solo:
[A]            [D]            [A]I just have to wait, because I got to have
[A]faith,      [D]faith,      [A]I got to, got to, got to have faith

Pre-Chorus:
Be[D]fore this river b[A]ecomes an ocean
Be[D]fore you throw my heart back on the fl[A]oor (I - just - got - to have faith)
Oh-baby-I re[D]consider my f[A]oolish [F#m7]notion
Well I n[Bm]eed someone to hold me but I'll w[E]ait for something more….[N.C.]

Chorus:
Cause I gotta have [A]faith, I gotta have faith

Because I gotta have faith, faith, faith

I gotta have faith, faith, a-faith ah
