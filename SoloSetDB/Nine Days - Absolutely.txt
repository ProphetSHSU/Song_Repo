Chorus:
This is the [Csus2]story of a [G]girl,
who cried a river and [A7sus4]drowned the whole [D]world
and while she [Bm]looks so sad in [Csus2]photographs,
I [A7sus4]absolutely love her
when she [G]sm[D]il[Csus2]es [G][D][Csus2]

1St Verse:
[Bm]How many days in a [Csus2]year
she [G]woke up with hope but she [D]only found tears
And [Bm]I can be so in[Csus2]sincere
[G]making the promises [D]never for real
As [Bm]long as she stands there [Csus2]waiting
[G]Wearin' the holes in the [D]soles of her shoes
[Bm]How many days [Csus2]disappear
You [G]look in the mirror, so [D]how do you choose

Pre-Chorus:
Your [Em]clothes never wear as [Dsus4/F#]well the next day
and your [G]hair never falls in [A7sus4]quite the same way,
[Em]you never seem to [Dsus4/F#]run out of things to [A7sus4]say

2Nd Verse:
[Bm]How many lovers would [Csus2]stay
just to [G]put up with this every[D]day and all day
[Bm]How did we wind up this [Csus2]way,
[G]watching our mouths for the [D]words that we say
As [Bm]long as we stand here [Csus2]waiting
[G]wearing the clothes of the [D]souls that we choose
[Bm]How do we get there [Csus2]today
When we're [G]walking too far for the price of [D]our shoes

Pre-Chorus:
Your [Em7]clothes never wear as [Dsus4/F#]well the next day
