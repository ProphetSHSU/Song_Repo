Verse:
[G]Sometimes late at [Am7]night
[D]I lie awake and watch her [C/G]sleep[G]ing[Am/G][G]
She's [D]lost in peaceful [Am7]dreams
So I turn [D]out the lights and [C]lay there in the [G]dark[C/G][G]
[G]And the thought crosses my [Am7]mind
[D]If I never wake up in the [C/G]morni[G]ng[Am/G][G]
[D]Would she ever [Am7]doubt the [D]way I feel
[C]About her in my [G]heart[C/G][G]

Chorus:
[G]If tomorrow never [C]comes
Will she know how much I [G]loved her
Did I try in every [D]way to [Am7]show her every [D]day
That [C]she's my only [G]one
And if my [Am7]time on [G/B]earth were [C]through
And she must face this [D]world with[Em7]out me[Bm7]
[Em]Is the love I gave her in the [Am7]past
Gonna be enough to [D]last
If tomorrow never [G]comes[D/G][C/G]

Verse:
[G]'Cause I've lost l[Am7]ove ones in my life
[D]Who never knew how much I [C/G]loved[G] them[Am/G][G]
Now I [D]live with the reg[Am7]ret
That my tr[D]ue feelings for the[C]m never were reve[G]aled[C/G][G]
[G]So I made a promise to mysel[Am7]f
[D]To say each day how much she me[C/G]ans t[G]o me[Am/G][G]
[D]And avoid that ci[Am7]rcumstance
Where there's no[D] second chance [C]to tell her how[G] I f[C/G]eel[G]

Chorus:
[G]If tomorrow never [C]comes
Will she know how much I [G]loved her
Did I try in every [D]way to [Am7]show her every [D]day
That [C]she's my only [G]one
And if my [Am7]time on [G/B]earth were [C]through
And she must face this [D]world with[Em7]out me[Bm7]
[Em]Is the love I gave her in the [Am7]past
Gonna be enough to [D]last
If tomorrow never [G]comes[D/G][C/G]

[G]So tell that someone that you [Am7]love
Just what you`re thinking [D]of
If tomorrow never [C]comes[G/B][Am7][G]
