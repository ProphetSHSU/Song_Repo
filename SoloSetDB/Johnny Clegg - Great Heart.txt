G            C        D
The world is full of strange behaviour
G     C          D
Every man has to be his own saviour
G            C             D
I know I can make it on my own if I try
G       C               D
But I'm searching for a Great Heart to stand me by
G              C       D
Underneath the African sky
G                C        D
A Great Heart to stand me by

Chorus:
Em   G                C              D          
I'm searching for the spirit of the Great Heart
Em   G                C              D          
To hold and stand me by
Em   G                C              D          
I'm searching for the spirit of the Great Heart
Em   G                C              D          
Under African sky
Em   G                C              D         
I'm searching for the spirit of the Great Heart
Em   G                C              D          
I see the fire in your eyes
Em   G                C              D          
I'm searching for the spirit of the Great Heart
Em   G                C              D          
That beats my name inside
Em   G                C              D          Em  G   C   D
Sometimes I feel that you really know me
Em   G                C              D          Em  G   C   D
Sometimes there's much you can show me
G          C          D
There's a highway of stars across the heavens
G               C           D
The whispering song of the wind in the grass
G            C              D
There's the rolling thunder across the savanna
G            C          D
A hope and dream at the edge of the sky
G         C         D
And your life is a story like the wind
G     C         D
Your life is a story like the wind

[Chorus]
Em   G                C              D          
I'm searching for the spirit of the Great Heart
Em   G                C              D          
To hold and stand me by
Em   G                C              D          
I'm searching for the spirit of the Great Heart
Em   G                C              D          
Under African sky
Em   G                C              D         
I'm searching for the spirit of the Great Heart
Em   G                C              D          
I see the fire in your eyes
Em   G                C              D          
I'm searching for the spirit of the Great Heart
Em   G                C              D          
That beats my name inside
Em   G                C              D          Em  G   C   D
Sometimes I feel that you really know me
Em   G                C              D          Em  G   C   D
Sometimes there's much you can show me
Em G    C   D          Em  G   C   D
Guk a 'mzimba (body grow old)
Em G   C   D          Em  G   C   D
Sala 'nhliziyo (but heart remain behind)
