Verse:
[G]Look around your [C]world, pretty baby.
[G]Is it everything you [C]hoped it would [D]be?
[G] The wrong guy, the wr[C]ong situation,
[G] The right [C(strum)]time to roll to [G]me.

Verse:
[G]Look into your [C]heart, pretty baby.
Is it [G]aching with some [C]nameless [D]need?
Is there [G]something wrong and you [C]can't put your finger on it?
[G] Right [C]th[(strum)]en, roll to [G]me.

Bridge:
And I [Dm]don't think I have [Cm]ever seen a [G]soul so in [Am]despair...
So [G]if you want to [C]talk the night through,
[Am]Guess who will be [D]there?

Verse:
So [G]don't try to de[C]ny it, pretty baby,
You've been [G]down so long you can [C]hardly [D]see.
When the [G]engine's stalled, it [C]won't stop runnin',
 It's the [G]right [C(strum)]time to roll to [G]me.

Verse:
So [G]look around your [C]world, pretty baby.
Is it [G]everything you [C]hoped it would [D]be?
[G] The wrong guy, the wr[C]ong situation,
[G] The right [C]time to roll to [G]me.
 The right [C]time to roll to [G]me.
 The right [C]time to roll to [G]me.
