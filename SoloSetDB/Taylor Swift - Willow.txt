Intro:
[Em][D][Em][D]
[Em][D][C]

Verse:
[Em]I'm like the water when your [D]ship rolled in that [Em]night[D]
[Em]Rough on the surface, but you [D]cut through like a [C]knife
[Em]  And if it was an [D]openshut case
[Em]  I never would've [D]known from that look on your [Em]face
Lost in your [D]current like a priceless[C]wine

Chorus:
[G] The more that you [D]say, the less I [Am]know
Wherever you [Em]stray, I follow[G]
I'm begging for [D]you to take my [Am]hand
Wreck my [Em]plans, that's my man

{c: pause 2}

Verse:
[Em]Life was a willow and it [D]bent right to your [Em]wind[D]
[Em]Head on the pillow, I could [D]feel you sneakin'[C]in
[Em]  As if you were a [D]mythical thing
[Em]  Like you were a [D]trophy or a champion [Em]ring
And there was one [D]prize I'd cheat[C]to win

Chorus:
[G] The more that you [D]say, the less I [Am]know
Wherever you [Em]stray, I follow[G]
I'm begging for [D]you to take my [Am]hand
Wreck my [Em]plans, that's my [G]man
You know that my [D]train could take you [Am]home
Anywhere [Em]else is hollow[G]
I'm begging for [D]you to take my [Am]hand
Wreck my [Em]plans, that's my man

Interlude:
[Bm]   [Em]   
[Am]Life was a willow and it 
[G]bent right to your [Bm]wind[Em]
[Am]  They count me out[G] time 
and time again

[Bm][Em]
[Am]Life was a willow and it 
[G]bent right to your [Bm]wind[Em]
[Am]  But I come back stron[G]ger than a nineties trend

Verse:
[Em]Wait for the signal, and I'll [D]meet you after [Em]dark[D]
[Em]Show me the places where the [D]others gave you[C]scars
[Em]  Now this is an [D]openshut case
[Em]  I guess I should've [D]known from the look on your [Em]face
Every baitand[D]switch was a work of[C]art

Chorus:
[G] The more that you [D]say, the less I [Am]know
Wherever you [Em]stray, I follow[G]
I'm begging for [D]you to take my [Am]hand
Wreck my [Em]plans, that's my [G]man
You know that my [D]train could take you [Am]home
Anywhere [Em]else is hollow[G]
I'm begging for [D]you to take my [Am]hand
Wreck my [Em]plans, that's my[G]man
The more that you [D]say, the less I [Am]know
Wherever you stray, [Em]I follow[G]
I'm begging for [D]you to take my [Am]hand
Wreck my [Em]plans, that's my [G]man
You know that my [D]train could take you [Am]home
Anywhere [Em]else is hollow[G]
I'm begging for [D]you to take my [Am]hand
Wreck my [Em]plans, that's my[G] man[D]

Outro:

Every baitand[Em]switch was a work of[G] art That's my[D]
man
[Am]  Hey, that's my [Em]man
[G] I'm begging for [D]you to take my [Am]hand
Wreck my [Em]plans, that's my man
