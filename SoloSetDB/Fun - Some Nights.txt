Intro:
[C]Some nights I stay up ca[F]shing in my b[C]ad luck.
[F]Some nights I [C]call it a [G]draw.
[C]Some nights I wish that my li[F]ps could build a c[C]astle.
[F]Some nights I w[C]ish they'd just fa[G]ll off
[F]But I stil[C]l wake up, I[F] still see[C]your ghost.
Oh Lord, I'm st[F]ill not su[C]re what I s[G]tand for, oh.
[F]What do I s[C]tand for? W[F]hat do I [C]stand for?
[Am]Most nights, I don't kn[G]ow anymore

Verse:
[F]This is it, boys. [C]This is war.
[F]What are we w[C]aiting for?
[F]Why don't we b[C]reak the rules alr[G]eady?
I was n[F]ever one to b[C]elieve the hype.
[F]Save that for the bl[C]ack and white.
I try t[F]wice as hard and I'm [C]half as liked,
But h[G]ere they come again to jack my style
And that's alri[F]ght[C]
I found a ma[F]rtyr in my b[C]ed tonight.
She [F]stops my bones from w[C]ondering
Just [G]who I am, who I am, who I [F]am.[C]
Yeah, oh [F]who [C]am I   [F] mmm[C]m   mm[G]mmm

Hook:
[F]Some nights I [C]wish that this a[F]ll would e[C]nd
'Cause I[F] could use some [C]friends for a ch[G]ange.
And s[F]ome nights I[C]'m scared you'll [F]forget me [C]again.
Some n[F]ights, I always w[C]in (I [G]always win)
But I s[F]till w[C]ake up, I still[F] see your g[C]host.
Oh Lord, I [F]still don't [C]know what I [G]stand for, oh.
What d[F]o I s[C]tand for? What d[F]o I s[C]tand for?
[Am]Most nights, I don't [G]know

Bridge:
[F]So this is it? I[C]sold my soul for this?
[G]Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
[F]No. When I see stars, when i s[C]ee stars, that's all they are.
When I he[G]ar songs, they sound like a swan.
So come o[F]n. Oh, come [C]on. Oh, come [G]on. Oh, come on!

Verse:
[F]That is it, guys, th[C]at is all.
[F]Five minutes in and [C]I'm bored again.
[F]Ten years of this, and I'm not [C]sure if anyb[G]ody understands.
[F]This is not one for the fol[C]ks back home.
[F]I'm sorry to leave, Mom, I [C]had to go.
[F]Who the fuck wants to [C]die alone all [G]dried up in the desert sun?

Verse:
[F]My heart is breaking for my sister
And the c[C]on that she called love.
But when I l[G]ook into my nephew's eyes,
[F]Man, you wouldn't believe
[C]The most amazing things that can come f[G]rom.
Some terrible nig[F]hts.

Outro:
[F]The other night, you [C]wouldn't believe the dr[F]eam I just had [C]about you and me
[F]I called you up[C], but we'd b[G]oth agree
[F]It's for the [C]best you didn't l[F]isten[C]
[F]It's for the[C] best we get our d[G]istance.
take it home!
