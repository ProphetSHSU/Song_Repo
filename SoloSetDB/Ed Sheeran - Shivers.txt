Intro:
[Bm][G][D]

[A] I took an arrow to the [Bm]heart

Verse:
I never kissed a mouth that [G]tastes like yours
Strawberries and [D]somethin' more
Ooh yeah, I want it all[A]
Lipstick on my gui[Bm]tar (Ooh)
Fill up the engine, we can [G]drive real far
Go dancin' under[D]neath the stars
Ooh yeah, I want it all[A]
Mh, you got me feelin' like

Pre-Chorus:
[Bm]I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
[G]I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I'm
[D]Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day[A]and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like

Chorus:
[Bm]Oh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're [G]close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, [D]you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they [A]say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, [Bm]oh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're [G]close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, [D]you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they [A]say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Verse:
Into the [Bm]car, on the back seat in the [G]moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your [D]legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough[A]
You know you could tear me a[Bm]part (Ooh)
Put me back together and [G]take my heart
I never thought that I could [D]love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough[A]
Mh, you got me feelin' like

Pre-Chorus:
[Bm]I wanna be that guy
I wanna kiss your eyes
[G]I wanna drink that smile
I wanna feel like I'm
[D]Like my soul's on fire
I wanna stay up all day[A]and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like

Chorus:
[Bm]Oh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're [G]close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, [D]you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they [A]say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, [Bm]oh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're [G]close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, [D]you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they [A]say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Bridge:
Baby, [Bm]you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the [G]fire you got
This thing is started, I don't [D]want it to stop
You know you make me shiver,[A]er, er
Baby, [Bm]you burn so hot
You make me shiver with the [G]fire you got
This thing is started, I don't [D]want it to stop
You know you make me shiver,[A]
Yeah, you got me singin' like

Chorus:
[Bm]Oh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're [G]close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, [D]you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks

And we'll say, [Bm]oh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're [G]close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, [D]you wanna dance till the sunlight cracks
And when they [A]say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back (Hey)
