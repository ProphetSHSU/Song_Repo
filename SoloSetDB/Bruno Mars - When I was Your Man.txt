Intro:
[D7][Dm7][C]

[D7][Dm7][C][G/B]

Verse:
[Am]  Same bed, but it [C]feels just a little bit [Dm]bigger now
[G]  Our song on the [G7]radio, but it don't [C]sound the same[Em/B]
[Am]  When our friends talk a[C]bout you all it does is just [Dm]tear me down
[G]  Cause my heart breaks a little when I [C]hear your name

Pre-Chorus:
It [Em/B]all just sounds like [Am]ooh, ooh, oooh, [Em]oooh
[Bb]Mmm too young, too dumb to real[C/G]ize

Chorus:
That [G]I should've bought you [F]flowers[G] and held your [C]hand
Shoulda gave you all my [F]hours[G] when I had[C]the chance
Take you to every [F]party cause all you [G]wanted to do was [Am]dance
[D7]Now my baby's [F]dancing, but she's [Fm]dancing with another [C]man[F][C][Em/B]

Verse:
[Am]  My pride, my [C]ego, my needs and my [Dm]selfish ways
[G]  Caused a good strong [G7]woman like you to walk [C]out my life[Em/B]
Now I'll [Am]never, [C]never get to clean up the [Dm]mess I made ooh
[G]  And that haunts me every time I close[C]my eyes

Pre-Chorus:
It [Em/B]all just sounds like [Am]ooh, ooh, oooh, [Em]oooh
[Bb]Mmm too young, too dumb to real[C/G]ize

Chorus:
That [G]I should've bought you [F]flowers[G] and held your [C]hand
Shoulda gave you all my [F]hours[G] when I had[C]the chance
Take you to every [F]party cause all you [G]wanted to do was [Am]dance
[D7]Now my baby's [F]dancing, but she's [Fm]dancing with another [C]man

Bridge:
Although it [F]hurts I'll be the [G]first to say that I was [C]wr[G/B]ong[Am][Em/G]
Oh, I [D7]know I'm probably much too late
To try and a[Dm7]pologize for my mistakes
But I just [G]want you to know

Chorus:
I hope he buys you [F]flowers[G], I hope he holds your [C]hand
Give you all his [F]hours[G] when he has[C]the chance
Take you to every [F]party cause I re[G]member how much you [Am]love to dance
[D7]Do all the things I [F]should've done[Fm] when I was your [C]man
[D7]Do all the things I [F]should've done[Fm] when I was your [C]man
