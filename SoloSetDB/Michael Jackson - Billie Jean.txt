Intro:
[F#m7]

Verse:
[F#m7]She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one[Bm7]
Who will dance on the floor in the round[F#m7]
She said I am the one[Bm7]
Who will dance on the floor in the round[F#m7]
[F#m7]She told me her name was Billie Jean,
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that
Dreamed of being the one[Bm7]
Who will dance on the floor in the round[F#m7]

Bridge:
[Dmaj7]People always told me be [F#m7]careful of what you do
And [Dmaj7]don't go around breaking young girls' hearts,[F#m7]uh uh uh
And [Dmaj7]mother always told me be [F#m7]careful of who you love
And [D]be careful of what you do
[C#]'Ð¡ause the lie becomes the truth, heyhey

Chorus:
[F#m7]Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
[Bm7]   But the kid is not my son[F#m7]
She says I am the one,[Bm7]   but the kid is not my son[F#m7]

Verse:
[F#m7]For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans[Bm7]'cause we danced
On the floor in the round[F#m7]
So take my strong advice,[Bm7]
Just remember to always think[F#m7]twice
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three
Then she looked at me
She showed a photo of a baby crying
His eyes looked [Bm7]like mine
Go on dance, on the floor
In the [F#m7]round, [Dmaj7]baby

Bridge:
People always told me [F#m7]be  careful of what you do
[Dmaj7]And  don't go around breaking young girls' [F#m7]hearts
[Dmaj7]She  came and stood right by [F#m7]me
Then the smell of sweet perfume [D]this
Happened much too soon
[C#]She called me to her room[F#m7]

Chorus:
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the[Bm7]one
But the kid is not my[F#m7]son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the[Bm7]one
But the kid is not my [F#m7]son
She says I am the[Bm7]one,
But the kid is not my[F#m7]

Interlude:
[F#m7]son
She says I am the [Bm7]one,
But the kid is not my [F#m7]son [F#m7]

Chorus:
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the[Bm7]one
But the kid is not my [F#m7]son
She says I am the[Bm7]one,
But the kid is not my[F#m7]son
She says I am the

Outro:
[F#m7]one,
She says he is my son
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lo[F#m7]ver

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
