Intro:  
[G][D][Em][C]

[G]Let them in Peter, F[D]or they are very tired
Give them co[Em]uches where the angels sleep, And li[C]ght those fires
Let them wake wh[G]ole again, To br[D]and new dawns
F[Em]ired by the sun, Not war-times bl[C]oody guns
May their pe[G]ace be deep, Remember where the br[D]oken bodies lie
God k[Em]nows how young they were, To h[C]ave to die
Well God kn[G]ows how young they w[D]ere, To h[Em]ave to die[C]
Give them th[G]ings they like, Let them m[D]ake some noise
Give d[Em]ance hall bands not golden harps, To th[C]ese our boys
Let them lo[G]ve Peter, For they've h[D]ad no time
They should have [Em]bird songs and trees, And hi[C]lls to climb
The taste of su[G]mmer, And a rip[D]ened pear
And g[Em]irls sweet as meadow wind, And fl[C]owing hair
And tell them h[G]ow they are missed, But s[D]ay not to fear
It's g[Em]onna be all right, [C]   With us down h[G]ere

[G]Let them in Peter, F[D]or they are very tired
Give them co[Em]uches where the angels sleep, And li[C]ght those fires
Let them wake wh[G]ole again, To br[D]and new dawns
F[Em]ired by the sun, Not war-times bl[C]oody guns

May their pe[G]ace be deep, Remember where the br[D]oken bodies lie
God k[Em]nows how young they were, To h[C]ave to die

And tell them h[G]ow they are missed, But s[D]ay not to fear
It's g[Em]onna be all right, [C]   With us down h[G]ere
