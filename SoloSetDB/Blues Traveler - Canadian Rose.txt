[G]Autumn [D]air it[C]carries me there
[G]Less than an [D]hour t[C]o go
[G]Six hu[D]ndred m[C]iles an hour
And [Em]still it feels so s[D]low
[G]I'm trying to [D]get back to B[C]urlington
To a [G]square in the [D]center of to[C]wn
To a [G]spot on a [D]wooden[C]table
Where her [Em]feet didn't reach the [D]ground
And when she [G]kisses me it [D]tasted like[C]cinnamon
And her [G]skin smelled of [D]cider and[C]rose
And when she [G]looked at me we [D]both got q[C]uiet
And my heart beats so [Em]hard we were in [D]so close
[G]Once for such a beautiful [D]while that still makes me[G]smile

And she [G]called me her[D] ugly A[C]merican
And I would [G]call her my C[D]anadian[C]flower
And I [G]don't think that we'll [D]ever be th[C]ere again
We had such [Em]powe[D]r
And she would [G]call me he[D]r ugly[C]American

And I'll [G]remember my Cana[D]dian r[C]ose
[G]Especially when the f[D]all comes to B[C]urlington
We were in so [Em]close[D]

Harmonica solo: intro chords

I [G]finally made [D]it this town looks re[C]arranged
I [G]don't know these [D]people a[C]nymore
But in th[G]e best ways [D]not much[C]else has changed
From the [Em]way it was be[D]fore
[G]And at least they still [D]have this certa[C]in table
Where I [G]once carved a par[D]ticular[C]name
I run my [G]fingers through the [D]weathered[C]carving
And I [Em]almost can feel the[D]same
And my [G]mouth it almost [D]tastes just like c[C]innamon
As I po[G]nder what my [D]pilgrimage m[C]eans
And I t[G]ry to [D]figure out where Van[C]couver is from here
And I [Em]listen to the[D]leaves
[G]If only for a beautiful [D]while that still makes me[G]smile

And she [G]called me her[D] ugly A[C]merican
And I would [G]call her my C[D]anadian[C]flower

And I [G]don't think that we'll [D]ever be th[C]ere again
We had such [Em]powe[D]r
And she would [G]call me he[D]r ugly[C]American
And I'll [G]remember my Cana[D]dian r[C]ose
[G]Especially when the f[D]all comes to B[C]urlington
We were in so [Em]close[D]

Harmonica Solo:
                        Second and third time softer
And every single [G]hope and dream [D]I could ever[C]conjure up
Passionately s[G]prings in me and[D] all things ar[C]e possible
Plausible and [G]perfectly [D]both of ours for[C]ever after and every day
[Em]At least it seemed [D]that way
[G]Once for such a beautifu[D]l while that still makes me[G]smile

And she [G]called me her[D] ugly A[C]merican
And I would [G]call her my C[D]anadian[C]flower
And I [G]don't think that we'll [D]ever be th[C]ere again
We had such [Em]powe[D]r
And she would [G]call me he[D]r ugly[C]American
And I'll [G]remember my Cana[D]dian r[C]ose
[G]Especially when the f[D]all comes to B[C]urlington
We were in so [Em]close[D]
