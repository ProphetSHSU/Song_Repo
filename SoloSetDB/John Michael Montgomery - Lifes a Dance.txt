Verse:
When [G]I was 14, I was fallin' fast
For a [C]blue-eyed girl in my homeroom class
[G]Tryin' to find the courage to ask her out
Was like [C]tryin' to oil from a water spout

Pre-Chorus 1:

[D]What she would've said I can't say
I [C]never did ask then she moved away
But [D]I learned something from my blue-eyed girl
[C]Sink or swim, you gotta [D]give it a [G]whirl

Chorus:
[G]Life's a dance, you [D]learn as you [G]go
[D]Sometimes you lead, [G]sometimes you follow
[Am]Don't worry 'bout what [C]you don't [D]know
[C]Life's a dance, you [D]learn as you [G]go

Verse:
The [G]longer I live the more I believe
You [C]do have to give if you wanna receive
There's a [G]time to listen, a time to talk
and you [C]might have to crawl even after you walk

Pre-Chorus 2:

[D]Had sure things blow up in my face
[C]Seen the long shot win the race
[D]Been knocked down by the slammin' door
[C]Picked myself up and cam[D]e back for[G]more

Chorus:
[G]Life's a dance, you [D]learn as you [G]go
[D]Sometimes you lead, [G]sometimes you follow
[Am]Don't worry 'bout what [C]you don't [D]know
[C]Life's a dance, you [D]learn as you [G]go

Chorus:
[A]Life's a dance, you [E]learn as you [A]go
[E]Sometimes you lead, [A]sometimes you follow
[Bm]Don't worry 'bout what [D]you don't [E]know
[D]Life's a dance, you [E]learn as you [A]go

[A]Life's a da[D]nce
[A]Life's a da[D]nce (Take a chance on love)
[A]Life's a da[D]nce
You [D]learn as you [A]go
