Intro:
[G][C9][G][D][C9]

Verse 1:
[G]Strands in your eyes, that c[C9]olor them wonderful
[G]Stop me and steal my br[D]eath[C9]
[G]Emeralds from mountains t[C9]hrust toward the sky
[G]Never revealing their d[D]epth [C9]

[G]Tell me that [C9]we belong to[D]gether
[G]Dress it up with the tr[C9]appings of l[D]ove
[G]I'll be captivated, I'll [C9]hang from your lips
[G]Instead of the gallows of h[D]eartache that hangs from abo[C9]ve[D][C9]

Chorus:
[G]And I'll be y[C9]our crying shoulder
[G]I'll be love s[D]uicid[C9]e
[G]I'll be b[C9]etter when I'm older
[G] I'll be the g[D]reatest [C9]fan of your l[G]ife[D][C9]

Verse 2:
[G]Rain falls a[C9]ngry on the tin roof
As [G]we lie awake in my b[D]ed [C9]
And y[G]ou're my survival, you're [C9]my living proof
My l[G]ove is alive, and not d[D]ead [C9]

[G]Tell me that [C9]we belong to[D]gether
[G]Dress it up with the tr[C9]appings of l[D]ove
[G]I'll be captivated, I'll [C9]hang from your lips
[G]Instead of the gallows of h[D]eartache that hangs from abo[C9]ve[D][C9]

Chorus:
[G]And I'll be y[C9]our crying shoulder
[G]I'll be love s[D]uicid[C9]e
[G]I'll be b[C9]etter when I'm older
[G] I'll be the g[D]reatest [C9]fan of your l[G]ife[D][C9]

Bridge:
And I've d[Bm]ropped out, I've burned up,
I've f[D]ought my way back from the d[C9]ead.
I've t[Bm]uned in, turned out,
Rem[D]embered the things that you s[C9]aid[D][C9]

Chorus:
[G]And I'll be y[C9]our crying shoulder
[G]I'll be love s[D]uicid[C9]e
[G]I'll be b[C9]etter when I'm older
[G] I'll be the g[D]reatest [C9]fan of your l[G]ife
