Verse:
[G]I climbed a mountain and [C]never came [G]back
I will not quit, and I [D]always fight [G]back
And from this moment, [C]for all my [G]life
What could I [Em]say
I was [C]born to be this [G]way
And what could I [Em]say
Just [C]living for [G]today

I'm from a small town, [C]of hard-working f[G]olks
Were all born rich and we [D]all died [G]broke
And from this moment, [C]forever I can [G]hope

Pre-Chorus:
What could I [Em]say
I was [C]born to be this [G]way
And what could I [Em]say
Just [C]living for [G]today

Chorus:
And we all [C]know that the sun will [G]shine
I must [C]go and chase this dream of [G]mine
And I [Em]know I can do you[C]proud
When I'm [G]high above those [D]clouds, at [G]all

Verse:
I don't sing well, [C]but I got a lot of [G]heart
This world's a pirate, and I'm [D]swimming with the [G]sharks
And in the sunlight, [C]I'm shaking like it's [G]dark

Pre-Chorus:
What could I [Em]say
I was [C]born to be this [G]way
And what could I [Em]say
Just [C]living for [G]today

Chorus:
And we all[C] know that the sun will[G]shine
I must [C]go and chase this dream of [G]mine
And I [Em]know I can do you[C]proud
When I'm [G]high above those [D]clouds

And we all[C] know that the sun will[G]shine
I must [C]go and chase this dream of [G]mine
And I [Em]know I can do you[C]proud
When I'm [G]high above those [D]clouds

Bridge:
And [C]I can't sleep, but I'm [G]fine
There's a [D]soldier, soldier [Em]in my mind
And [C]I can't sleep, but I'm [G]fine
There's a [D]soldier, soldier [Em]in my mind
There's a s[D]oldier, soldier i[Em]n my mind
There's a [D]soldier, soldier [Em]in my mind
There's a [D]soldier, soldier [Em]in my mind
There's a [G]soldier, soldier in [A]my min[C]d

Chorus:
And we all[C] know that the sun will[G]shine
I must [C]go and chase this dream of [G]mine
And I [Em]know I can do you[C]proud
When I'm [G]high above those [D]clouds

And we all[C] know that the sun will[G]shine
I must [C]go and chase this dream of [G]mine
And I [Em]know I can do you[C]proud
When I'm [G]high above those [D]clouds[C][G]
