[Bm]  If not w[A]ith you, then f[D]or you, my l[G]ove
[Bm]  While I'm br[A]eathin', y[D]ou're never g[G]one

But I'm tr[Bm]ying, tr[A]ying to k[D]eep my head up

[Bm]  I still sl[A]eep on my s[D]ide of our b[G]ed
[Bm]  Though you're g[A]one you're not le[D]avin' me y[G]et

But I can w[D]ait
To be with you d[A]arlin' somed[Bm]ay

The l[G]ight has gone out in my l[Bm]ife
St[G]uck in the p[A]ast
