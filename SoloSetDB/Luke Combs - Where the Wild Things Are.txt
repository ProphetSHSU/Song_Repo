Intro:
[E]
My big brother rode an [A]Indian Scout

Verse 1:
It was black like his ja[E]cket
American Spirit hangin' [A]outta his mouth
Just like our da[E]ddy
He kicked[C#m]started that bike one 
[A]night and broke mama's heart
[E]  He pointed that h[A]eadlight 
West[B], out where the wild things are
[E]  He'd call me up every[A] couple of weeks

Verse 2:
From South Califo[E]rnia
Talk about the desert and the [A]Joshua Tree
And his pretty girl st[E]ories
How he bought an [C#m]Airstream trailer 
and a [A]J45 guitar
[E]  Said, "Little brother, you'd[A] love it out 
here[B], out where the wild things are"

Chorus:
[E]  [C#m]Oh, oh[A]oh, it's hearts on 
[E]fire and crazy dreams
[B]  [C#m]Oh, oh[A]oh, the nights 
ig[E]nite like gasoline
[B]  And light u[A]p  those streets 
that[E/G#] never sleep when the [F#m]sky goes dark
[B]Out where the wild things are
[E]  I called my brother from the[A] back of that plane

Verse 3:
The second I ma[E]de it
We started drinkin' on the 
[A]strip in L.A
And then it got cr[E]azy
Ended [C#m]up at a house in the 
[A]hills with some Hollywoo[E]d  stars
Kissin' on a blonde in a [A]backyard pool,
[B] out where the wild things[C#m] are

Guitar Solo:
[A]  [E]  [B]  [C#m]  
Oh[A],  [B] yeah
Couple i[Asus2]ron   horse rebels

Bridge:
Wild as the devil
I knew[Bsus4]      I had to move back East
Said goodbye [Asus2]to    my brother
At the end of that summer
But I kn[Bsus4]ew    he'd never leave

Chorus:
[C#m]Oh, oho[A]h, it's hearts on 
f[E]ire and crazy dreams
[B]  [C#m]Oh, [A]  where the nights 
ign[E]ite like gasoline
[B]  And[C#m] oh, o[A]hoh, them 
Indian S[E]couts, man, they're built for speed
[B]  And [C#m]oh, oh[A]oh, they said he hit that 
[E]guardrail at half pa[B]st three
Lit up[A]  those streets that 
[E/G#]never sleep when the s[F#m]ky goes dark
We b[A]uried him [E/G#]out  in the wind 'neath the 
Wes[F#m]t  Coast stars
[B]  Out where the wild things are

Outro:
[E]  [A]  [B]  Out where the wild things [E]are
