Intro:
[Bm][Dmaj7][G]

[A]  [Bm]  Ooh,[Dmaj7]     ooh[G][A]

Verse:
[Bm]Every time you come around,[Dmaj7]     you know I can't say [G]no
[A]  [Bm]Every time the sun goes down,[Dmaj7]     I let you take con[G]trol[A]

Pre-Chorus:
[Bm]I can feel the paradise[Dmaj7]     before my world imp[G]lodes
[A] And to[Bm]night had some[Dmaj7]thing wonder[G]ful
My bad [A]habits lead to [Bm]late nights, endin’ alone

Chorus:
[Dmaj7]     Conversations with a [G]stranger I barely know
Swearin' [A]this will be the [Bm]last, but it probably won't
[Dmaj7]     I got nothin' left to [Em]lose, or use, or [G]do
My bad [A]habits lead to [Bm]wide eyes starin' at space
[Dmaj7]     And I know I'll lose con[G]trol of the things that I say
Yeah, I was [A]lookin' for a [Bm]way out, now I can't escape
[Dmaj7]     Nothin' happens after [Em]two, it's truÐµ, it's [G]true
My bad [A]habits lead to [Bm]you

Bridge:
Ooh-ooh,[Dmaj7]ooh-ooh
[G] My bad [A]habits lead to [Bm]you
Ooh-ooh,[Dmaj7]ooh-ooh
[Em]   [G] My bad [A]habits lÐµad to you

Verse:
[Bm]Every pure intention ends[Dmaj7]     when the good times[G]start
[A]  [Bm]Fallin' over everything[Dmaj7]     to reach the first-time[G]spark

Pre-Chorus:
[A] It [Bm]started under neon lights[Dmaj7]     and then it all got[G]dark
[A] I [Bm]only know[Dmaj7]     how to go too [G]far
My bad [A]habits lead to [Bm]late nights, endin’ alone

Chorus:
[Dmaj7]     Conversations with a [G]stranger I barely know
Swearin' [A]this will be the [Bm]last, but it probably won't
[Dmaj7]     I got nothin' left to [Em]lose, or use, or [G]do
My bad [A]habits lead to [Bm]wide eyes starin' at space
[Dmaj7]     And I know I'll lose con[G]trol of the things that I say
Yeah, I was [A]lookin' for a [Bm]way out, now I can't escape
[Dmaj7]     Nothin' happens after [Em]two, it's truÐµ, it's [G]true
My bad [A]habits lead to [Bm]you

Bridge:
Ooh-ooh,[Dmaj7]ooh-ooh
[G] My bad [A]habits lead to [Bm]you
Ooh-ooh,[Dmaj7]ooh-ooh
[Em][G][A]

Interlude:
[Bm]We took the long[Dmaj7]     way 'round[G]
[A]  [Bm]And burned 'til the fun[Dmaj7]     ran out,[Em]now
[G] My bad [A]habits lead to [Bm]late nights, endin’ alone

Chorus:
[Dmaj7]     Conversations with a [G]stranger I barely know
Swearin' [A]this will be the [Bm]last, but it probably won't
[Dmaj7]     I got nothin' left to [Em]lose, or use, or [G]do
My bad [A]habits lead to [Bm]wide eyes starin' at space
[Dmaj7]     And I know I'll lose con[G]trol of the things that I say
Yeah, I was [A]lookin' for a [Bm]way out, now I can't escape
[Dmaj7]     Nothin' happens after [Em]two, it's truÐµ, it's [G]true
My bad [A]habits lead to [Bm]you
