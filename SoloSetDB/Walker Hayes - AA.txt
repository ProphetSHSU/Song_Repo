Verse:
C[A]offee cup cold and black
W[A]ish it had a little shot of Jack
'S[Bm]ides that, can't complain

K[D]ids need shoes, mama needs Levi’s[E]

Chorus:
[E]And I'm just tryna keep my d[A]aughters off the pole
And my s[A]ons out of jail
T[Bm]ryna get to church so I don't go to hell
I'm just t[E]ryna keep my wife from figuring out
That [D]I married up and s[E]he married way way d[A]own

T[Bm]ryna write a song the local country station will p[D]lay
Hey I'm just t[E]ryna stay out of A[A]A[E]

Verse:
Well I g[A]ave up Skoal and cigarettes
N[A]ow I'm just hooked on Nicorette

T[Bm]rying not to be like my old man
But the o[Bm]lder I get the more I am

H[E]ey y'all at the end of the day y'all
I[D]'m just another John Deere guy
[E]Up on a tractor

Chorus:
Tryna steer my d[A]aughters off the pole
And my s[A]ons out of jail
