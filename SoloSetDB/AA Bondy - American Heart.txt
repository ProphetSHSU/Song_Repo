We were [C]raised by [Gadd11]wolves
And[C] we are still w[F]ild
And we howl when the[Am] troubled wind [Gadd11]blows

Oh, [C]assassins will [F]lie
If we just [Am]go down [Gadd11]slow

All the people you meet
Dow[C]n in the street[F]s
May be good but t[Am]hey don't wanna[Gadd11]know

Life is sweet at the[Am] bottom of the [Gadd11]sea

Fat[C]hers stay up al[F]l night
With a chill that go[Am]es to the bones[Gadd11]

The[C]n he's no God I[F]know
'Cause Christ would [Am]not send boys t[Gadd11]o die

Whe[C]n the peace dov[F]e is felled
By men with the blac[Am]kest of minds[Gadd11]

Let[C] the sighin’ be[F]gin
As we're bound for t[Am]he longest of d[Gadd11]ays
