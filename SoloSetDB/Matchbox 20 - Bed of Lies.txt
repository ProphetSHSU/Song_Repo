No i [Bb]would not sl[F]eep in this be[C]d of li[Dm]es
[Bb]So toss me o[F]ut and tu[C]rn i[Dm]n
And there'll b[Bb]e no re[F]st for these tir[C]ed ey[Dm]es
I'm marki[Bb]ng it dow[F]n to lea[C]rni[Dm]ng
I [Bb]Am

[F]Don't think that i can take ano[Bb]ther empty mom[F]ent
[F]Dont think that i can fake ano[Bb]ther hollow sm[F]ile
[C]It's not en[Dm]ough just to be lo[Bb]nely.
D[F]on't think that I could take ano[Bb]ther talk about [F]it

Ju[C]st like me you got needs
And they're on[Dm]ly a whi[Bb]sper aw[C]ay
And we sof[C]tly surrender
To these l[Dm]ies that we've
t[Bb]endered a[C]way

No i wo[Bb]uld not sl[F]eep in this b[C]ed of l[Dm]ies
[Bb]So toss me o[F]ut and tu[C]rn i[Dm]n
And there'll b[Bb]e no re[F]st for these tir[C]ed e[Dm]yes
I'm mar[Bb]king it do[F]wn to l[C]ear[Dm]ning
I'm mark[Bb]ing it do[F]wn to lea[C]rni[Dm]ng
I [Bb]Am

[F]Don't wanna be the one who t[Bb]urns the whole thing ov[F]er
[F]Don't wanna be somewhere where [Bb]i just dont bel[F]ong
[C]Where it's not eno[Dm]ugh just be sorr[Bb]y
[F]Don't you know I feel the dar[Bb]kness closing [F]in

[C]Tried to be more than me
And I ga[Dm]ve 'til it a[Bb]ll went aw[C]ay
And we've on[C]ly surrendered
To the wo[Dm]rst part of these win[Bb]ters we've m[C]ade

But i wo[Bb]uld not sl[F]eep in this b[C]ed of l[Dm]ies
[Bb]So toss me o[F]ut and t[C]urn [Dm]in
And there'll b[Bb]e no r[F]est for these ti[C]red ey[Dm]es
I'm mar[Bb]king it do[F]wn to lea[C]rni[Dm]ng
I'm mar[Bb]king it d[F]own to l[C]earn[Dm]ing
I[Bb]Am

I am a[Dm]ll that I'll ever be
when yo[C]u lay your hands over [Dm]me
but don't go we[Gm]ak on me now
I kn[Bb]ow that it's weak
But God he[Bb]lp me I need th[C]is

I[Bb] will not sl[F]eep in this be[C]d of l[Dm]ies
[Bb]So toss me o[F]ut and tu[C]rn in
And there'll [Bb]be no r[F]est for these tir[C]ed ey[Dm]es
I'm ma[Bb]rking it do[F]wn to le[C]arni[Dm]ng
I'm ma[Bb]rking it do[F]wn to le[C]arni[Dm]ng
I[Bb]Am
