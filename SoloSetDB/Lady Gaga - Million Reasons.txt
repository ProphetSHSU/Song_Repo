Intro:
[C][Am]

[F][G]

Verse:
You're [C]giving me a million reasons to let you go
You're [Am]giving me a million reasons to quit the show
You're [F]givin' me a million reasons[Fsus2]
Give me a million reasons
[G]Givin' me a million reasons
[G]About a million reasons

[C]If I had a highway, I would run for the hills
[Am]If you could find a dryway, I'd forever be still
But you're [F]giving me a million reasons[Fsus2]
Give me a million reasons
[G]Givin' me a million reasons
[G]About a million reasons

Chorus:
[F]I bow [C]down to [Am]pray
I try to make the [G]worst seem better
[F]Lord, show [C]me the [Am]way
To cut through all his [G]worn out leather
[F]I've got a [C]hundred million [Am]reasons to walk [G]away
But [F]baby, I just need one [C]good one to stay

Verse:
[C]Head stuck in a cycle, I look off and I stare
[Am]It's like that I've stopped breathing, but completely aware
'Cause you're [F]giving me a million reasons[Fsus2]
Give me a million reasons
[G]Givin' me a million reasons
[G]About a million reasons

And [C]if you say something that you might even mean
It's [Am]hard to even fathom which parts I should believe
'Cause you're [F]giving me a million reasons[Fsus2]
Give me a million reasons
[G]Givin' me a million reasons
[G]About a million reasons

Chorus:
[F]I bow [C]down to [Am]pray
I try to make the [G]worst seem better
[F]Lord, show [C]me the [Am]way
To cut through all his [G]worn out leather
[F]I've got a [C]hundred million [Am]reasons to walk [G]away
But [F]baby, I just need one good one to stay[Am]

Bridge:
Hey, [F]ehh, ehh, eyy[C]
Baby I'm [G]bleedin', bleedin'
[Am]ehh, ehh, [F]ehhy
[C]Can't you give me what I'm [G]needin', needin'
[F]Every heart[C]break makes it [G]hard to keep the [Am]faith
But[F]baby, I just need one good one

Good one, good one, good one, good one, good one

Chorus:
When [F]I bow [C]down to [Am]pray
I try to make the [G]worst seem better
[F]Lord, show [C]me the [Am]way
To cut through all his [G]worn out leather
[F]I've got a [C]hundred million [Am]reasons to walk [G]away

But [F]baby, I just need one good one, good one
[F]Tell me that you'll be the good one, good one
[F]Baby, I just need one [Am]good one to stay[F][C]
