Verse:
[G]  [A] His [Em]eyes are cold and restless
And his [A]wounds have almost healed[Em]
And [A]she'd give half of Te[Em]xas Just to change[A]
the way he feels
[Em]She knows his love's in Tulsa
And she knows[A]he's gonna go
But it [Em]ain't no woman flesh and blood
It's that [B]damned old rodeo, oh

Chorus:
Well, it's [Em]bulls and blood
It's the dust and mud
It's the [A]roar of a Sunday crowd[Em]
It's the white in his knuckles
The gold in his buckle
He'll [B]win the next go [D]'round[G]
It's [Em]boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's [A]spurs and latigo[Em]
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain
And they [B]call the thing rode[Em]o

[G]  [A] She [Em]does her best to hold him

Verse:
When [A]his love comes to call[Em]
But his [A]need for it controls[Em]  him and her back's[A]
against the wall
[Em]And it's, "So long girl, I'll see you"
When it's time[A]for him to go
You know the [Em]woman wants her cowboy
Like he [B]wants his rodeo

Chorus:
Well, it's [Em]bulls and blood
It's the dust and mud
It's the [A]roar of a Sunday crowd[Em]
It's the white in his knuckles
The gold in his buckle
He'll [B]win the next go [D]'round[G]
It's [Em]boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's [A]spurs and latigo[Em]
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain
And they [B]call the thing rode[Em]o

[G]  [A] It'll [Em]drive a cowboy crazy

Verse:
It'll [A]drive the man insane[Em]
And he'll [A]sell off everything[Em]he owns
Just to [A]pay to play her game
[Em]And a broken home and some broken bones
Is [A]all he'll have to show
For all the [Em]years that he spent chasin' This dream[B]
they call rodeo

Chorus:
Well, it's [Em]bulls and blood
It's the dust and mud
It's the [A]roar of a Sunday crowd[Em]

It's [Em]boots and chaps
It's cowboy hats
It's [A]spurs and latigo[Em]
It's the ropes and the reins
And the joy and the pain

It's the broncs and the blood
It's the steers and the mud
