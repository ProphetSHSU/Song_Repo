Intro:
[F][Fsus4]
[F][Fsus2]

Verse:
[F] I thought I saw a man brought to life[Am]
He was warm, he came around like he was dig[Bb7]nified
He showed me what it was to cry
[F]Well you couldn't be that man I adored
[Am]You don't seem to know, don't seem to care
What your [Bb7]heart is for
No, I don't know him anymore

Pre-Chorus:
There's [Dm]nothin' where he used to lie
[C]Our conversation has run dry
[Am]That's what's going on
[C] Nothing's fine, I'm t[F]orn

Chorus:
I'm all out of f[C]aith
This is how I fe[Dm]el,
I'm cold and I am sha[Bb]med
Lying naked on the floor[F]
Illusion never changed[C]
Into something real[Dm]
Wi de awake and I[Bb]  can see the perfect sky is torn[F]
You'r a little late[C]
I'm already torn[Dm][Bb]

Verse:
[F]So I guess the fortune teller's right
[Am]I should have seen just what was the re
And not some [Bb7]holy light
But you crawled beneath my veins and now

Pre-Chorus:
[Dm]I don't care, I have no luck
[C]I don't miss it all that much
[Am]There's just so many things
[C] That I can't touch, I'm torn[F]

Chorus:
I'm all out of faith[C]
This is how I feel,[Dm]
I'm cold and I am shamed[Bb]
Lying naked on the floor[F]
Illusion never chan[C]ged
Into something real[Dm]
I'm wide awake and I[Bb]  can see the perfect sky is torn[F]
You're a little late[C]
I'm already torn[Dm]
[Bb]   [Dm]Torn[Bb]

Pre-Chorus:
[Dm]   [F]  [C] There's [Dm]nothing where he used to lie
[C]My in spi ra tion has run dry
[Am]  And that's what's goin' on[C]
Nothin's right, I'm torn[F]

Chorus:
I'm all out of faith[C]
This is how I feel[Dm]
I'm cold and I am shamed[Bb]
Lying naked on the floor[F]
Illusion never chan[C]ged
Into something real[Dm]
I'm wide awake and I[Bb]  can see the perfect sky is torn[F]
I'm all out of faith[C]
This is how I feel,[Dm]
I'm cold and I'm ashamed[Bb]
Bound and broken on the floor[F]
You're a little late[C]
I'm already torn[Dm]
[Bb]  Torn[Dm]
[C]Oh
