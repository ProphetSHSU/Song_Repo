Intro:
[G][D][Em][C]

Verse:
[G]I met you in the dark
[D]You lit me up
[Em]You made me feel as though
[C]I was enough

[G]We danced the night away
[D]We drank too much
[Em]I held your hair back when
[C]You were throwing up

Pre-Chorus:
[G]Then you smiled over your shoulder
[D]For a minute, I was stone cold sober
[Em]I pulled you closer to my [C]chest

[G]And you asked me to stay over
[D]I said, I already told ya
[Em]I think that you should get some [C]rest

Chorus:
[G]I knew I loved you then
[D]But you'd never know
[Em]Cause I played it cool when I was
[C]Scared of letting go

[G]I know I needed you
[D]But I never showed
[Em]But I wanna stay with you
[C]Until we're grey and old

[G]Just say you won't let g[D]o
[Em]Just say you won't let g[C]o

Verse:
[G]I wake you up with some
[D]Breakfast in bed
[Em]I'll bring you coffee with a
[C]kiss on your head

[G]And I'll take the kids to school
[D]Wave them goodbye
[Em]And I'll thank my lucky stars for
[C]That night

Pre-Chorus:
[G]When you looked over your shoulder
[D]For a minute, I forget that I'm older
[Em]I wanna dance with you right [C]now, oh

[G]And you look as beautiful as ever
[D]And I swear that everyday you'll get better
[Em]You make me feel this way so[C]mehow

Chorus:
[G]I'm so in love with you
[D]And I hope you know
[Em]Darling your love is more than worth its
[C]Weight in gold

[G]We've come so far my dear
[D]Look how we've grown
[Em]And I wanna stay with you
[C]Until we're grey and old
[G]Just say you won't let [D]go
[Em]Just say you won't let [C]go

Verse:
[G]I wanna live with you
[D]Even when we're ghosts
[Em]Cause you were always there for me
[C]When I needed you most

Chorus:
[G]I'm gonna love you till
[D]My lungs give out
[Em]I promise till death we part
[C]Like in our vows

[G]So I wrote this song for you
[D]Now everybody knows
[Em]That it's just you and me
[C]Until we're grey and old
