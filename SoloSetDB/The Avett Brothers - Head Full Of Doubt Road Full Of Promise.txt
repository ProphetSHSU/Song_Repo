[G][D][C][Em]
[G][D][C][Em]

Verse:
There’s a [G]darkness up[D]on me that’s [C]flooded in [Em]light
In the [G]fine print they [D]tell me what’s [C]wrong and what’s [Em]right
And it [G]comes in [D]black and it [C]comes in [Em]white
And I’m [Em]frightened by [D]those that don’t [C]see it

When [G]nothing is [D]owed or [C]deserved or [Em]expected
And your [G]life doesn’t [D]change by the [C]man that’s [Em]elected
If you’re [G]loved by [D]someone, you’re [C]never [Em]rejected
Dec[Em]ide what to [D]be and go [C]be it

Chorus:
[C]There was a [G]dream and one [C]day I could [G]see it
Like a [C]bird in a [G]cage I broke [D]in and dem[C]anded that [D]somebody [G]free it
And [C]there was a [G]kid with a [C]head full of [G]doubt
So I’ll [C]scream til I [G]die and the [D]last of those [C]bad thoughts are [D]fina[G]lly[D] ou[C]t[Em]
