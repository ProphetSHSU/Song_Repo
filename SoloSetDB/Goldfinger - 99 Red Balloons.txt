[D]You and I in[Em]a little toy shop
Buy a [G]bag of balloons with

'Til [G]one by one, [A]they were gone

[D]Floating in [Em]the summer sky
[G]99 [A]red balloons go [D]by

[G]Floating in the [A]summer sky
[D]Panic bells, it's [Em]red alert
There's [G]something here from [A]somewhere else
The [D]war machine [Em]springs to life
[G]Opens up one [A]eager eye
[D]Focusing it [Em]on the sky
As [G]99 r[A]ed balloons go [D]by

If [D]I could find a [Em]souvenir

I [G]think of you and [A]let it go
