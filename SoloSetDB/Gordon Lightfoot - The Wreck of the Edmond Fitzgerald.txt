[G/A][D/A][Asus2][A]

Verse:
The [A]legend lives on from the [Em]Chippewa on down
Of the [G]big lake they [D]called "Gitche [Asus2]Gumee"[A]
The lake, it is said, never [Em]gives up her dead
When the [G]skies of No [D]vember turn [Asus2]gloomy[A]
With a [A]load of iron ore twenty-six [Em]thousand tons more
Than the [G]Edmund Fitz [D]gerald weighed [Asus2]empty.[A]
That good [A]ship and crew was a [Em]bone to be chewed
When the "[G]Gales of No [D]vember" came [Asus2]early. [A]

Verse:
The [A]ship was the pride of the A [Em]merican side
Coming [G]back from some [D]mill in Wis [Asus2]consin
As the [A]big freighters go, it was [Em]bigger than most
With a [G]crew and good [D]captain well [Asus2]seasoned
Con [A]cluding some terms with a [Em]couple of steel firms
When they [G]left fully [D]loaded for [Asus2]Cleveland
And [A]later that night when the [Em]ship's bell rang
Could it [G]be the north [D]wind they'd been [Asus2]feelin’?

[A] [G/A][D/A][Asus2][A]

Verse:
The [A]wind in the wires made a [Em]tattle-tale sound
And a [G]wave broke [D]over the [Asus2]railing[A]
And [A]every man knew, as the [Em]captain did too,
T'was the [G]witch of No [D]vember come [Asus2]stealin'.[A]
The [A]dawn came late and the [Em]breakfast had to wait
When the [G]Gales of No [D]vember came [Asus2]slashin'.
When [A]afternoon came it was [Em]freezin' rain
In the [G]face of a [D]hurricane [Asus2]west wind.

[G/A] [D/A][Asus2][A]

Verse:
When [A]suppertime came, the old [Em]cook came on deck
Sayin’, "[G]Fellas, it's [D]too rough to [Asus2]feed ya."[A]
At [A]Seven P.M. a main [Em]hatchway caved in',
he said "[G]Fellas, it's [D]been good t'[Asus2]know ya"[A]
The captain wired in he had [Em]water comin' in
and the [G]good ship and [D]crew was in [Asus2]peril.
And [A]later that night when 'is [Em]lights went outta sight
Came the [G]wreck of the [D]Edmund Fitz [Asus2]gerald.

Verse:
Does any one know where the [Em]love of God goes
When the [G]waves turn the [D]minutes to [Asus2]hours?[A]
The [A]searchers all say they'd have [Em]made Whitefish Bay
If they'd [G]put fifteen more [D]miles be [Asus2]hind her.[A]
They [A]might have split up or they [Em]might have capsized;
They [G]may have broke [D]deep and took [Asus2]water.
And [A]all that remains is the [Em]faces and the names
Of the [G]wives and the [D]sons and the [Asus2]daughters.

[G/A][D/A][Asus2][A]

Verse:
Lake Huron rolls, Su [Em]perior sings
In the [G]rooms of her [D]ice-water [Asus2]mansion.
Old [A]Michigan steams like a [Em]young man's dreams;
The [G]islands and [D]bays are for [Asus2]sportsmen.[A]
And [A]farther below Lake On [Em]tario
Takes [G]in what Lake [D]Erie can [Asus2]send her,
And the [A]iron boats go as the [Em]mariners all know
with the [G]Gales of No [D]vember re [Asus2]membered.

Verse:
In a [A]musty old hall in De [Em]troit they prayed,
In the "[G]Maritime [D]Sailors' Ca [Asus2]thedral."[A]
The [A]church bell chimed till it rang [Em]twenty-nine times
For each [G]man on the [D]Edmund Fitz [Asus2]gerald.[A]
The [A]legend lives on from the [Em]Chippewa on down
Of the [G]big lake they [D]call "Gitche [Asus2]Gumee".[A]
"Su [A]perior", they said, "never [Em]gives up her dead
When the '[G]Gales of No [D]vember' come [Asus2]early!”
