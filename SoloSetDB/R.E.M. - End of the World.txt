Verse:
[G]That's great, it starts with an [Cmaj7]earthquake,
birds and snakes, an [G]aeroplane - Lenny Bruce is[Cmaj7]not afraid.
[G]Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn
[Cmaj7]world serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs.
[G]Feed it up a knock, speed, grunt no, strength no.
[Cmaj7]Ladder structure clatter with fear of height, down height.
[Bb]Wire in a fire, represent the seven games
in a [Am]government for hire and a combat site.

[G]Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the furies breathing do[Cmaj7]wn your neck.
[G]Team by team reporters baffled, trump, tethered crop.
Look at that [Cmaj7]low plane!  Fine then.
[G]Uh oh, overflow, population, common group, but i[Cmaj7]t'll do.

Save yourself, serve yourself.
World serves its [G]own needs, listen to your heart bleed.
Tell me with the [Cmaj7]rapture and the reverent in the right - right.
You [Bb]vitriolic, patriotic, slam, fight, bright light, [Am]feeling pretty psyched.

Chorus:
It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as[Am]we know it
It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as [Am]we know it
It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as [Am]we know it and I feel fine[C]

Verse:
[G]Six o'clock - TV hour.  Don't get caught in foreign tower.
Slash [Cmaj7]and burn, return, listen to yourself churn.
[G]Lock him in uniform and book burning, blood letting.
Every [Cmaj7]motive escalate.  Automotive incinerate.
[G]Light a candle, light a motive.  Step down, step down.
Watch a h[Cmaj7]eel crush, crush.
Uh oh, this means [G]no fear - cavalier.  Renegade and steer clear!
[Cmaj7]A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies.
[Bb]Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives and I[Am]decline.

Chorus:
It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as[Am]we know it
It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as [Am]we know it
It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as [Am]we know it and I feel fine[C][Cmaj7]
[G]    I feel[Cmaj7] fine[G][Cmaj7][G][F]

It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as[Am]we know it
It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as [Am]we know it
It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as [Am]we know it and I feel fine[C]
Bridge:
[G]The other night I tripped a nice continental drift divide.
Mount [Cmaj7]St. Edelite.  Leonard Bernstein.
[G]Leonid Breshnev, Lenny Bruce and Lester Bangs.
[Cmaj7]Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom!
You [Bb]symbiotic, patriotic, slam, but neck, [Am]right?  Right.

Chorus:
It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as[Am]we know it
It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as [Am]we know it
It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as [Am]we know it and I feel fine[C]

[G]

It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as[Am]we know it

It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as [Am]we know it and I feel fine[C]

It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as[Am]we know it
It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as [Am]we know it
It's the [G]end of the[Dsus2] world as [Am]we know it and I feel fine[C]
