Chorus:
I'm not a[G]fraid of getting [C]ol[G]der
I'm one l[Em]ess day from dying [G]young
I see the [G]light go past my [C]shoul[G]der
I'm one le[Em]ss day from dying [G]young

Verse:
I see my [G]life like a [C]train with a one-way [G]track
I've made mis[D]takes, and I [C]couldn't take 'em [G]back
And I've been [G]runnin' 'round in circles 'til I'm [C]dizzy, I can't [G]lie
But [D]every night I go to sleep's a [C]day that I sur[G]vive

Chorus:
I'm not a[G]fraid of getting [C]ol[G]der
I'm one l[Em]ess day from dying [G]young
I see the [G]light go past my [C]shoul[G]der
I'm one l[Em]ess day from dying [G]young

Verse:
And I've seen my [G]friends fall a[C]way before their [G]time
And I've been a[D]fraid that I may [C]follow in their [G]light
So I [G]drink and love and whisper all the [C]things I know are [G]right
[D]Someday, I will leave this world, but [C]maybe not to[G]night

Chorus:
I'm not a[G]fraid of getting [C]ol[G]der
I'm one l[Em]ess day from dying [G]young
I see the [G]light go past my [C]shoul[G]der
I'm one l[Em]ess day from dying [G]young
I'm one l[Em]ess day from dying [G]young

Bridge:
[G]All my life I have been[C] wande[G]ring
[C]Burning up my [G]candle like my [D]time just won't end
And [G]I'll keep burning 'til there'[C]s nothing [G/B]left
[Em]Praying that tomorrow I can [C]do it all a[G]gain
And [Em]if I get tomorrow, I will [C]do it all a[G]gain

Chorus:
I'm not a[G]fraid of getting [C]ol[G]der
I'm one l[Em]ess day from dying [G]young
I see the [G]light go past my [C]shoul[G]der
I'm one l[Em]ess day from dying [G]young

Chorus:
I'm not a[G]fraid of getting [C]ol[G]der
I'm one l[Em]ess day from dying [G]young
I see the [G]light go past my [C]shoul[G]der
I'm one [Em]less day from dying [G]young (from dying young!)
I'm one [Em]less day from dying [G]young (from dying young!) Hey!

Outro:
