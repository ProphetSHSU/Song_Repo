Verse:
Well I'm[C] on the Down[G]- easter [Am]A- lexa
And I'm[C] cruising throu[G]gh Block Isla[F]nd Sound.
I have[F] chartered [C]a course to t[Dm]he Vineyard.
But to-[C] night I a[G]m Nantuc[F]ket boun[C]d [-][F]

Chorus 1:

 [F] We took o[G]n diesel back [C]in Montauk yes[F]ter- day,
 [F] And left thi[G]s morning from t[Am]he bell in Gardin[G/B]er's Bay.
 [F] Like all t[G]he locals here I'[C]ve had to sell[F]my home,
 [F] Too proud t[G]o leave, I worked [Am]my fingers to [G/B]the bone

Verse:
So I could[C] own my Dow[G]n- easter [Am]A- lexa
And I [C]go where th[G]e ocean [F]is deep.
There are[F] giants o[C]ut there in t[Dm]he canyons.
And a[C] good captai[G]n can't fall [F]a- slee[C]p [-][F]

Chorus 2:

 [F] I go[G]t bills to pay [C]and children who n[F]eed clothes.

 [F] But I've g[G]ot people back [Am]on land who count[G/B]on me.

Bridge:
So when you[C] see my Down[G]- easter [Am]A- lexa
And if you[C] work with th[G]e rod and t[F]he reel,
Tell my[F] wife I a[C]m trolling A[Dm]t- lantis,
And I[C] still have m[G]y hands on t[F]he wheel.

Verse:
Now I[C] drive my Dow[G]n- easter [Am]A- lexa
More and[C] more miles fro[G]m shore ev[F]'ry year,
Since they[F] told me [C]I can't sell [Dm]no stripers.
And there's[C] no luck i[G]n sword fishi[F]ng here.

Chorus 3:

 [F] I was [G]a bayman like [C]my father was [F]be- fore.
