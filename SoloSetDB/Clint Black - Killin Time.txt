Verse:
[A]You were the fi[D]rst thing that I thought of
when I thought I drank you off my mi[G]nd.
When I get lost in the li[D]quor
you're the only one I f[A]ind.
If I [D]did the things I oughta
you still would not be [G]mine
So I keep a tight grip on the [D]bottle
gettin l[A]oose and killing [D]time.

Chorus:
[D]This killin [G]time. is killin me[D].
Drinkin myself b[A]lind thinkin I won't [D]see
that if I cross that line[G]  and they bur-y m[D]e
well, I just might f[C]ind I'll be killin [G]time for eter[D]nity.

Verse:
I don't kn[D]ow nothin bout tommorow,
I've been lost in yesterd[G]ay.
I spent all my life just d[D]ying for
a love that passed a[A]way.
There's an [D]end to all my sorrow
this is the only price I'll pa[G]y.
I'll be a happy man whe[D]n I go,
and I can’t [A]wait another[D]day.

Chorus:
[D]This killin [G]time. is killin me[D].
Drinkin myself b[A]lind thinkin I won't [D]see
that if I cross that line[G]  and they bur-y m[D]e
well, I just might f[C]ind I'll be killin [G]time for eter[D]nity.

Outro:
Yes, I just might fi[C]nd I'll be killin t[G]ime for etern[D]ity.
