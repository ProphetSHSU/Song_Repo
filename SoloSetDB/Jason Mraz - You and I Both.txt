Verse:
Was it you [G]who spoke the words that things would[Gmaj7]happen but not to me
Oh thin[Em]gs are gonna happen naturally
Oh taki[Am]ng your advice and I'm looking on the bright side
And b[C]alancing the whole [D]thing
Oh but o[G]ften times those words they get tan[Gmaj7]gled up in lines
And the b[Em]right light turns to night
Oh unt[Am]il the dawn it brings another day to sing
About the m[C]agic that was you and [D]me

Cause you and I [G]both loved[Gmaj7]
What you and I s[Em]poke of
And others just r[Am]ead of
Others only r[C]ead of the l[D]ove
Of the love that I l[G]ove [Gmaj7]
yeah la-be-de-[Em]dum

See I'm all about them [G]words
Over [Gmaj7]numbers, unencumbered numbered [Em]words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for[Am]words
More words than I had ever [C]heard and I feel so a[D]live

Cause you and I b[G]oth loved[Gmaj7]
What you and I s[Em]poke of
And others just r[Am]ead of
And if you could s[C]ee me now oh l[D]ove love
Y[G]ou and I you and I
N[Gmaj7]ot so little you and I any[Em]more

And [Am]with this silence brings a moral story
more importantly e[C]volving is the glory of a [D]boy
Cause you and I b[G]oth loved[Gmaj7]
What you and I s[Em]poke of
And others just r[Am]ead of
And if you could s[C]ee me now
Well then I'm [D]almost finally o[G]ut of
Finally ou[Gmaj7]-ou-out of final-la-d[Am]e-de-de-da-de
Well I'm al[C]most finally f[D]inally well I am free oh I'm [G]free
and it's o[C]kay if you had to go a[Dm]way
oh just re[G]member the tele[D]phones well they workin 'em
[Em]both ways
But if I n[C]ever ever hear them [D]ring
if nothing [G]else I'll think the [D]bells inside
have f[Em]inally found you someone else and that's o[C]-o-okay
cause I'll [D]remember everything you sang
Cause you and I b[G]oth loved[Gmaj7]
What you and I s[Em]poke of
And others just r[Am]ead of
And if you could s[C]ee me now
Well then I'm al[D]most finally o[G]ut of
Finally ou[Gmaj7]-ou-out of final-la-d[Am]e-de-de-da-de
Well I'm al[C]most finally fi[D]nally well out of w[G]ords
