intro:
[C]SHE[G]'S GOT A TATTOO ON HER SHOULDER
IT'S A BLUE EYE WITH A TEAR

[C]SHE[G] GO[D]T IT DRINKIN' ONE NIGHT, WHEN HER THINKIN' WASN'T CLEAR
HE WAS SHORT BUT GOOD LOOKING, RUGGED GREEN EYES AND ANIMAL CHARM
THAT SILVER TONGUED DEVIL INSPIRED THAT LOVE SCAR ON HER ARM

chorus  G  D  Em  C
HE SAID 'IF I COULD BE A TEAR ROLLIN' DOWN YOUR CHEEK, 
AND DIE ON YOUR LIPS MY LIFE WOULD BE COMPLETE

[G]THE[D] WO[C]RDS[D] T[-]HA[C]T HE SAID REALLY HIT HER IN THE HEART,
SO NOW SHES WALKING ROUND 
WITH A LOVE SCAR.

[C]SHE[G] W[(4x)]AS JUS[-]T A[C]NOT[G]HER NOTCH ON HIS SNAKE SKIN BELT,
AND NOW SHE KNOWS 

[C]SO [G]SHE[D]HIDES IT UNDER A LONG SLEEVED BLOUSE
SO IT WON'T SHOW
SHE ONCE THOUGHT IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
IT'S NO LONGER A WORK OF ART

[C]THA[G]T I[D]NK NEEDLE DIDN'T HURT
BUT SHES GOT A LOVE SCAR 
ON HER HEART
