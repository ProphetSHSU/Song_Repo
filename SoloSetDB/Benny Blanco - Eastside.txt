[F#m     E   A]   
[D       D   E]   

Verse:
[F#m]When I was young,[E] I fell in [A]love
We [D]used to hold hands, man, that was enou[E]gh (yeah)
[F#m]Then we grew up, [E]started to [A]touch
[D]Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the [E]bus (yeah)
[F#m]Oh no, your daddy didn't [E]like me [A]much
And he [D]didn't believe me when I said you were the o[E]ne
Oh[F#m], every day s[E]he found a [A]way out o[D]f the window to sneak out late

Chorus:
She used to meet me on the Easts[F#m]ide
In the c[E]ity where the s[A]un don't s[D]et
And every d[E]ay you know that [F#m]we ride(cut short)
Through the backstr[E]eets in a[A] blue C[D]orvette
Baby, you know [E]I just wanna l[F#m]eave ton[E]ight
[A]We can go [D]anywhere we want
Drive d[E]own to the c[F#m]oast, jump in the [E]seat
[A]Just take my h[D]and and come with me

Post-Chorus:
[F#m]We can do anything [E]if we put our [A]minds to it
[D]Take your whole life then you put a l[E]ine through it

[F#m]My love is yours if you're [E]willing to t[A]ake it
[D]Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna b[E]reak it
[F#m](up)So come away,[E] (UP)star[A]ting today
[D]Start a new life, together in a different [E]place
We know that [F#m]love is how these ideas [E]came to [A]be
So baby, r[D]un away with m[E]e

Verse:
[F#m]Seventeen and w[E]e got a d[A]ream to have a f[D]amily
A house and everything in be[E]tween
And then, o[F#m]h, suddenly [E]we turned twenty-[A]three
Now we got [D]pressure for taking our life more serious[E]ly
We got our d[F#m]ead-end jobs and got [E]bills to p[A]ay
[D]Have old friends and know our enemie[E]s
Now I-, I[F#m]'m thinking back to [E]when I was [A]young
Back to the [D]day when I was falling in love

Chorus:
He used to meet me on the Eastsi[F#m]de
In the c[E]ity where the s[A]un don't s[D]et
And every d[E]ay you know that [F#m]we ride
Through the backstr[E]eets in a[A] blue C[D]orvette
Baby, you know [E]I just wanna l[F#m]eave ton[E]ight
[A]We can go [D]anywhere we want
Drive d[E]own to the c[F#m]oast, jump in the [E]seat
[A]Just take my h[D]and and come with me

Post-Chorus:
[F#m]We can do anything [E]if we put our [A]minds to it

[D]Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna b[E]reak it
[F#m]So come away, sta[E]rting tod[A]ay
[D]Start a new life, together in a different [E]place
We know that [F#m]love is how these ideas [E]came to [A]be
So baby, r[D]un away with m[E]e

[E] Run aw[A]ay, now
