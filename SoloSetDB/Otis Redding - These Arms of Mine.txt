[G]

These arms of [G]mine,
they are [D]lonely,[C]
lonely, and feeling [G]blue

These arms of mine,
they are [D]yearning,[C]
yearning, from wanting [G]you

And if you,[G7]

would let them
[C]Hold you, Oh, how [D7]grateful I will [G]be

These arms of [G]mine,
they are [D]burning,[C]
burning from wanting [G]you

These arms of mine,
they are [D]wanting,[C]
wanting to hold [G]you

And if you,[G7]

would let them
[C]Hold you, Oh, how [D7]grateful I will [G]be

[C]Come on, [D]come on [G]baby
Just be my little [C]woman [[D]yeah]
Just be my [G]lover oh I need some[C]body,
[[D]Someone] to treat me [G]right
[[G7]Ohh] I need your [C]warm [D]loving arms to hold me [G]tight
And [C]I need [D]your tender [G]lips too
[C]Hold me, [D]hold me . . .
