Verse:
I'm [D]only pretty sure that I can't take[A] anym[G]ore.  Before you
[D]take a swing, [A]I won[G]der what are we fighting
[D]for? When I say out loud, I want to get [A]out [G]of this, I wonder
I w[D]onder, is there anything I[A]'m [G]gonna miss?

Chorus 1:
I wonder, [Em]'how's it gonna be, when you[D] don't [A]know me?'
[Em]How's it gonna be, when you're s[D]ure I'm [G]not there?
[Em]How's it gonna be, when there's [D]no one t[A]here to talk to?
[Em]Between you and me? 'Cause [A]I do[G]n't care, how's it gonna
[D]be…[A][G]

Post-Chorus:
[D][A][G]
[D] [A][G]

Verse:
[D]Where we used to laugh, there's a shouting ma[A]tch.     [G]Sharp as a thumbnail
[D]scratch.  A silence I can't ignore.  Like the [A]hammock    by the[G]doorway
we spent [D]time in, swing's empty.  I don't see [A]lightning like last f[G]all,
when it was al[D]ways     about to h[A]it me[G]

Chorus 2:
[G]I wonder
[Em]How's it gonna be, when it g[D]oes [A]down,
[Em]How's it gonna be, when you're [D]not ar[G]ound,
[Em]How's it gonna be, when you [D]found out [A]there was nothing,
Betw[Em]een you and me, 'cause [D]I don't [G]care, How's it gonna
[D]be...[A][G]

Bridge:
[Em]How's it gonna [G]be when you don't [D]know me any[A]more
[Em]How's it gonna [G]be
[D]Wanna get myself bac[A]k in a[G]gain
the   [D] soft dive of [A] obli[G]vion
[D]I wanna taste the salt   of[A] your sk[G]in
the   [D] soft dive of   o[A]blivion[G],    oblivion
[Em]How's it gonna [G]be when you don't [D]know me any[A]more
[Em]How's it gonna [G]be

Post-Chorus:
[D][A][G]
[D] [A][G]
