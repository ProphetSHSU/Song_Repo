[C]Let's tell the world all the [F]things we've [C]done

[C][G][C]

[C]All of the places we [F]ever [C]go
[C]Feel familiar I'm [G]never [C]alone
[C]All of the people that [F]I don't [C]know
Will be looking me up when they [G]all get [C]home

[C]Let's tell the world all the [F]things we've [C]done
[C]Falling in love and the [G]setting [C]sun

And if you [F]tell the world your [C]secrets
You never [Am]kno[F]w what's set in stone
And what can [G]grow woah woah
