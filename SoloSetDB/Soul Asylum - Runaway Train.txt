Intro:
 [C][C][C][C]

Verse:
[C]Call you up in the middle of the night
[Em/B]Like a firefly without a light
[Am]You were there like a blowtorch burnin'
[G]I was a key that could use a little turnin'
[C]So tired that I couldn't even sleep
[Em/B]So many secrets I couldn't keep
[Am]Promised myself I wouldn't weep
[G]One more promise I couldn't keep

Pre-Chorus:
It [F]seems no one can [G]help me now
I'm [C]in too deep, there's [Am]no way out
[F]This time I have [Em]really led my[G]self astray

Chorus:
[C]Runaway train never going back
[Em]Wrong way on a one-way track
[Am]Seems like I should be getting somewhere
[G]Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Verse:
[C]Can you help me remember how to smile
[Em/B]Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
[Am]How on earth did I get so jaded
[G]Life's mysteries seem so faded
[C]I can go where no one else can go
[Em/B]I know what no one else knows
[Am]Here I am just drowning in the rain
[G]With a ticket for a runaway train

Pre-Chorus:
And [F]everything seems [G]cut and dry
[C]Day and night, [Am]earth and sky
[F]Somehow I [Em]just don't be[G]lieve it

Chorus:
[C]Runaway train never going back
[Em]Wrong way on a one-way track
[Am]Seems like I should be getting somewhere
[G]Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Instrumental:
[C][C][Em][Em]
[Am][Am][G][G]
[F][G][C][Am]
[F][Em][G][G]

Verse:
[C]Bought a ticket for a runaway train
[Em/B]Like a madman laughing at the rain
[Am]Little out of touch, little insane
[G]It's just easier than dealing with the pain

Chorus:
[C]Runaway train never going back
[Em]Wrong way on a one-way track
[Am]Seems like I should be getting somewhere
[G]Somehow I'm neither here nor there
[C]Runaway train never coming back
[Em]Runaway train tearing up the track
[Am]Runaway train burning in my veins
[G]I'd runaway but it always seems the same

Outro:
[C][C][Em][Em]
[Am][Am][G][G]
