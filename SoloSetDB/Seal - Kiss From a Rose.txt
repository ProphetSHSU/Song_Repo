Intro:
[Em]Duba dab[D]u dub[E]iduu...
[Em]Duba dab[D]u dub[E]iduu...

Verse:
[E]  There used to be a greying [C]tower a[D]lone on the [E]sea
You became the [C]light on the [D]dark side of [E]me
But love remains a [D]drug that´s the [A]high not the [E]pill
But did you know that when it [Em]snows,
My [C]eyes become [D]large and the [C]light that you [D]shine can be [E]seen

Chorus:
Ba[E]by I compare you to a [C]kiss from a [D]rose on the [E]grey
Ooh, the more I get of you the [C]stranger it [D]feels, ye[E]ah
And now that your [C]rose is in [D]bloom
A [C]light hits the [D]gloom on the [E]grey

Bridge:
[Em]Duba dab[D]u dub[E]iduu...

Verse:
[E]  There is so much a man can [C]tell you so [D]much he can [E]say
You remain my [C]power, my [D]pleasure, my [E]pain, [N.C.]baby,
to [C]me you´re like a growing ad[D]diction that I can´t de[E]ny
Won´t you tell me is that [C]healthy baby[D]
But did you [E]know that when it [Em]snows,
My [C]eyes become [D]large and the [C]light that you [D]shine can be [E]seen

Chorus:
Ba[E]by I compare you to a [C]kiss from a [D]rose on the [E]grey
Ooh, the more I get of you the [C]stranger it [D]feels, ye[E]ah
And now that your [C]rose is in [D]bloom
A [C]light hits the [D]gloom on the [E]grey

[Dsus2]  I´ve been [Asus2]kissed by a [G]rose on the [Dsus2]grey
I´ve been [Asus2]kissed by a [G]rose (on the grey)
[Dsus2]  I´ve been [Asus2]kissed by a [G]rose on the [Dsus2]grey
I´ve been [Asus2]kissed by a [G]rose (on the grey)

Verse:
[E]  There is so much a man can [C]tell you so [D]much he can [E]say
You remain my [C]power, my [D]pleasure, my [E]pain[N.C.]

A [C]light hits the [D]gloom on the [E]gray
