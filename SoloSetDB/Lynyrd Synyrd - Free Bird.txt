[G]If I [D]leave here to[Em]morrow
[F]Would you [C]still remember [D]me?
[G]For I must be [D]travelling [Em]on now
[F]Cos there's too many [C]places I must [D]see

[G]If I [D]stay here with [Em]you girl
[F]Things just [C]couldn't be the [D]same
[G]Cos I'm as [D]free as a [Em]bird now
[F]And this [C]bird you cannot [D]change
[F]And this [C]bird you cannot [D]change
[F]And this [C]bird you cannot [D]change
[F]Lord [C]knows I can't [D]change

[G]Bye bye, [D]it's been a [Em]sweet love
[F]Though this [C]feeling I can't [D]change
[G]But please don't [D]take it so [Em]badly
[F]Cos the Lord knows [C]I'm to [D]blame

[G]But if I [D]stay here with [Em]you girl
[F]Things just [C]couldn't be the [D]same
[G]Cos I'm as [D]free as a [Em]bird now
[F]And this [C]bird you cannot [D]change oh oh oh
[F]And this [C]bird you cannot [D]change
[F]And this [C]bird you cannot [D]change
[F]Lord [C]knows I can't [D]change

[F]Lord [C]help me I can't [D]change
[G]Lord [Bb]I can't [C]change
[G]Oh [Bb]I can't [C]change
