Intro:
[A]

[A]We never had that much to do
So we'd just lay around in someone’s [D]house
So[E]meday I’ll have it all again
Just like way back [A]when

[A]Back then we’d sleep until the afternoon
Then we'd just get up and go [D]outside
Open a [E]window, let the breeze blow in,
Forget everythi[A]ng

Yea,[D] those will be the [A]days that I will be [E]missing you[D]
When I’m older, when I’m [A]gray and when I’ll [E]stop working[D]
I hope that I can [A]say
When all my days are [E]done
We were just having fun[A]

[A]Well we’d go drinking in the afternoon
Lie out on the grass, and fall a[D]sleep
Oh will I e[E]ver see that girl again?
The girl from way back [A]when

[A]Yea, we used to share a cigarette
And t'row together everything we [D]had
And then go d[E]riving in my parents’ car
We never strayed too [A]far
Oh yea,[D] those will be the [A]days that I will be [E]missing you[D]
When I’m older, when I’m [A]gray and when I’ll [E]stop working[D]
I hope that I can [A]say
When all my days are [E]done
That I had my fun[A]

[D][A][E][A][E][D]

[D]Those will be the d[A]ays that I had my[E] fun[E7]
Yea,[D] time can move so [A]fast
Some [E]things are made t[E7]o last[E]
Here's to [D]you, my dear old [A]friend
From way[E]back when

Yea,[D] those will be the [A]days that I will be [E]missing you[D]
When I’m older, when I’m [A]gray and when I’ll [E]stop working[D]
I hope that I can [A]say
When all my days are [E]done
That I had my fun[A]
