Verse:
[Em]Another h[C]ead hangs lowly, [G]child is slowly t[D/F#]aken
[Em]And the violence [C]caused such silence, [G]who are we mista[D/F#]ken
But you [Em]see it's not me, it's not [C]my family
In your [G]head, in your head, they are fig[D/F#]hting
With their [Em]tanks and their bombs and their [C]bombs and their guns
in your h[G]ead, in your head, they are cr[D/F#]ying

Chorus 1:
In your [Em]head, in your [C]head, zombie,[G] zombie, zombi[D/F#]e
What's in your [Em]head, in your [C]head, zombie,[G] zombie, zombi[D/F#]e

Verse:
[Em]Another mo[C]ther's breaking hea[G]rt is taking ov[D/F#]er
[Em]When the violence [C]causes silence, [G]we must be mi[D/F#]staken
It's the [Em]same old theme since [C]1916
In your [G]head, in your head, they're still f[D/F#]ighting
With their [Em]tanks and their bombs and their [C]bombs and their guns
In your [G]head, in your head, they're d[D/F#]ying

Chorus 2:
In your [Em]head, in your [C]head, zombie,[G] zombie, zombi[D/F#]e
What's in your [Em]head, in your [C]head, zombie,[G] zombie, zombi[D/F#]e
