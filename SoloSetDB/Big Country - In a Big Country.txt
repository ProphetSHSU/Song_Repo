[E A C#m F#m]

[E]      [A]Come up screaming…
[C#m]        [A]Come up screaming…
[C#m] – [F#m]

E . . .

[E]  I've never seen you look like [A]this without a reason,
[E]  Another promise fallen [A]through, another [F#m]season [A]passes [B]by you.

[B][A][F#m]
       *shot!*

[E]  I never took the smile [A]away from anybody's face,
[E]  And that's a desperate way to [A]look for someone [F#m]who is s[A]till a [B]child.

Hook:
[C#m]      And in a [E]big country, [A]dreams [B]stay with you,[C#m]
Like a l[E]over's v[F#m]oice, fires the [E]mountain[B]side
[A]      Stay a[F#m]live

[E] [F#m]

[E]   I thought that pain and truth were [A]things that really mattered
But you [C#m]can't stay here with [F#m]every single hope you had [E]shattered

[E]  . . .

[E]   I'm not expecting to grow [A]flowers in the desert,
[E]   But I can live and breathe and [A]see the [F#m]sun in [A]winter[B]time

Hook:
[C#m]      And in a [E]big country, [A]dreams [B]stay with you,[C#m]
Like a l[E]over's v[F#m]oice, fires the [E]mountain[B]side
[A]      Stay a[F#m]live

[C#m]      And in a [E]big country, [A]dreams [B]stay with you,[C#m]
Like a l[E]over's v[F#m]oice, fires the [E]mountain[B]side
[A]      Stay a[F#m]live

[E] – [A] – [C#m] – [F#m]

[E]   So take that look out of [A]here, it doesn't fit you.
[C#m]    Because it's happened doesn't [F#m]mean you've been discarded
[E]   Pull up your head off the [A]floor, come up screaming
[C#m]   Cry out for everything you [F#m]ever might have wanted
[E]   I thought that pain and truth were [A]things that really mattered
But you [C#m]can't stay here with [F#m]every single hope you had [E]shattered

[E] . . .

[E]   I'm not expecting to grow [A]flowers in the desert,
[E]   But I can live and breathe and [A]see the [F#m]sun in [A]winter[B]time
