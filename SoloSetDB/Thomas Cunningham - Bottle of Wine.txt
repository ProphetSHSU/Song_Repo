Intro:
Verse One:
Tim[F#m]ing and its focu[A]s
It’s what [F#m]ruins and it [A]dopes us
Realit[A]y ain’t the s[F#m]ame, if you [A]don’t play the g[F#m]ame
Cause I’m ti[F#m]red and it’s hopeles[A]s
I’m not beate[A]n, but I’m bro[F#m]ken
[F#m]Words I’ve never [A]spoken
[A]What do you say? [A]what do you say?
[F#m]I guess you can’t look up to [A]me that way[F#m][A]
[F#m]I guess you can’t look up to [A]me that way[F#m][A]

Bridge One:

Verse Two:
[A]Is it fire or is it smo[F#m]ke?
[A]Or should we just go for br[F#m]oke
Here comes bo[F#m]redom and it’s [A]useless
I think [A]life should come all [F#m]inclusive
At [A]least a little less [F#m]abusive
[A]What do you say? [A]what do you say?
[F#m]I guess you can’t look up to [A]me that way[F#m][A]
[F#m]I guess you can’t look up to [A]me that way[A][A]
CHORUS: Play Once
The [A]bottle of wine was [F#m]fine this time
And I [D]really don’t think it’s[A]changed
The [A]bottle of wine was [F#m]fine this time.
But [D]oh, how I think you’ve [A]changed

Bridge Two:

Verse Three:
Tim[F#m]ing and its focu[A]s
It’s what [F#m]ruins and it [A]dopes us
Realit[A]y ain’t the s[F#m]ame, if you [A]don’t play the g[F#m]ame
Here comes bo[F#m]redom and it’s [A]useless
I think [A]life should come all [F#m]inclusive
At [A]least a little less [F#m]abusive
[A]What do you say? [A]what do you say?
[F#m]I guess you can’t look up to [A]me that way[F#m][A]
