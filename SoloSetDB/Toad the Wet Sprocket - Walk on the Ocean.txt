Verse:
We spotted the [G]oc[C]ea[G]n     at the [A]head of the [Em]tra[C]il[G]
But [A]where are we [G]go[C]in[G]g,     we're [D]so far [A]aw[Asus4]ay[A]
Somebody [G]to[C]ld[G] me     that [A]this is the [Em]pla[C]ce[G]
where [A]everything's [G]be[C]tt[G]er     and [D]everything's [A]sa[Asus4]fe[A]

Chorus:
Walk on the [Em]Ocean[G]    Step on the [D]stone[A]
Flesh becomes [Em]water[G]    Wood becomes [D]bone[A]

Verse:
A half an hour [G]la[C]te[G]r    We [A]packed up our [Em]thi[C]ng[G]s
We [A]said we'd send [G]le[C]tt[G]ers    And [D]all of those [A]li[Asus4]ttle t[A]hings
And they knew we were [G]ly[C]in[G]g    But they [A]smiled just the [Em]sam[C]e[G]
It s[A]eemed they'd [G]al[C]re[G]ady    For[D]gotten we [A]ca[Asus4]me[A]

Chorus:
Walk on the [Em]Ocean[G]    Step on the [D]stone[A]
Flesh becomes [Em]water[G]    Wood becomes [D]bone[A]

Verse:
Now back at the [G]ho[C]me[G]stead    Where the [A]air makes you [Em]cho[D/F#]ke[G]
Where [A]people don't [G]kn[C]ow[G] you    And [D]trust is a [A]jo[Asus4]ke[A]
Don't even have [G]pi[C]ct[G]ures    Just [A]memories to [Em]hol[D/F#]d[G]
It grows [A]sweeter each [G]se[C]as[G]on    As we [D]slowly grow [A]old
