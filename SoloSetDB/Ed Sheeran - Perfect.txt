Verse:
I found a [G]love for m[Em7]e
Darling just [Cadd9]dive right in, 
and follow my [D]lead

Well I found a [G]girl 
beauti[Em7]ful and sweet
Well I never [Cadd9]knew you were the 
someone waiting for [D]me

Pre-Chorus 1:
[N.C.]Cause we were just kids when we
[G]Fell in love, not knowing [Em7]what it was
I will not [Cadd9]give you up this [G]ti-i-i-[D]ime

But darling just [G]kiss me slow, 
your heart is [Em7]all I own
And in your [Cadd9]eyes you’re holding mi[D]ne

Chorus 1:
Baby [Em7]I’m [Cadd9]dancing in the [G]dark, 
with [D]you between my [Em7]arms
[Cadd9]Barefoot on the [G]grass, 
[D]listening to our [Em7]favorite song

When you [Cadd9]said you looked a [G]mess, 
I whispered [D]underneath my [Em7]breath
But you [Cadd9]heard it, darling 
[G]you look [D]perfect tonight

Verse:
Well I found a [G]woman, 
stronger than [Em7]anyone I know
She shares my [Cadd9]dreams, 
I hope that someday I’ll share her [D]home

I found a [G]love, 
to carry [Em7]more than just my secrets
To carry [Cadd9]love, to carry children of our [D]own

Pre-Chorus 2:
We are still kids, but we’re [G]so in love, 
fighting a[Em7]gainst all odds
I know we’ll [Cadd9]be alright this [G]ti-i-i-[D]ime

Darling just [G]hold my hand, 
be my girl, I’ll [Em7]be your man
I see my [Cadd9]future in your ey[D]es

Chorus 2:
Baby [Em7]I’m [Cadd9]dancing in the [G]dark, 
with [D]you between my [Em7]arms
[Cadd9]Barefoot on the [G]grass, 
[D]listening to our [Em7]favorite song
When I [Cadd9]saw you in that [G]dress, 
looking so [D]beautiful
I [Em7]don't de[Cadd9]serve this, darling 
[G]you look [D]perfect t[(G)]onight

I have [Cadd9]faith in what I [G]see,
