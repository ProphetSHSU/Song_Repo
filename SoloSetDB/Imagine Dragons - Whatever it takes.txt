Intro:
[Am][G]
[Em]
[Am][G]
[Em]

Verse:
[Am]Falling too fast to prepare for this
[G]Tripping in the world could be dangerous
[Em]Everybody circling is vulturous

Negative, Nepotist
[Am]Everybody waiting for the fall of man
[G]Everybody praying for the end of times
[Em]Everybody hoping they could be the one
[N.C.]I was born to run, I was born for this

Pre-Chorus:
[Am]Whip, whip
Run me like a [G]race horse
Pull me like a [D]rip cord
Break me down and [Em]build me up
I wanna be the [Am]slip, slip
Word upon your [G]lip, lip
Letter that you [D]rip, rip
Break me down and [Em]build me up

Chorus:
Whatever it [F]takes[C]
Cause I love the a[G]drenaline in my[Am]veins
I do whatever it [F]takes[C]
Cause I love how it [G]feels when I break the[Am]chains
Whatever it [F]takes[C]
Ya [G]take me to the top, I’m[Am]ready for
Whatever it [F]takes[C]
Cause I love the a[G]drenaline in my
[N.C.]Veins. I do what it takes

Verse:
[Am]Always had a fear of being typical
[G]Looking at my body feeling miserable
[Em]Always hanging on to the visual

I wanna be invisible
[Am]Looking at my years like a martyrdom
[G]Everybody needs to be a part of ‘em
[Em]Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

Pre-Chorus:
[Am]Whip, whip
Run me like a [G]race horse
Pull me like a [D]rip cord
Break me down and [Em]build me up
I wanna be the [Am]slip, slip
Word upon your [G]lip, lip
Letter that you [D]rip, rip
Break me down and [Em]build me up

Chorus:
Whatever it [F]takes[C]
Cause I love the a[G]drenaline in my[Am]veins
I do whatever it [F]takes[C]
Cause I love how it [G]feels when I break the[Am]chains
Whatever it [F]takes[C]
Ya [G]take me to the top, I’m[Am]ready for
Whatever it [F]takes[C]
Cause I love the a[G]drenaline in my
[N.C.]Veins. I do what it takes

Bridge:
[Am]Hypocritical, eg[G]otistical. Don’t wanna be the
[Em]Parenthetical, hypothetical, working onto
[Am]something that I’m proud of [G]out of the box an
[Em]Epoxy to the world and the vision we’ve lost. I'm an
[Am]Apostrophe, I’m just a [G]symbol to reminds you that there’s
[Em]More to see. I’m just a product of the system, a
Cat[Am]astrophe, and yet a [G]masterpiece, and yet I’m
[Em]Half diseased and when I am deceased, at least I
[Am]Go down to the grave and die [G]happily
Leave the [Em]body of my soul to be a part of thee
[N.C.]I do what it takes

Chorus:
Whatever it [F]takes[C]
Cause I love the a[G]drenaline in my[Am]veins
I do whatever it [F]takes[C]
Cause I love how it [G]feels when I break the[Am]chains
Whatever it [F]takes[C]
Ya [G]take me to the top, I’m[Am]ready for
Whatever it [F]takes[C]
Cause I love the a[G]drenaline in my
[N.C.]Veins. I do what it takes
