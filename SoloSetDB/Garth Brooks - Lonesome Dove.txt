[G]She was a girl on a wagon train
[C]headed [G]west a-cros[D]s the [G]plains.
The [Em]train got lost in a su[C]mmer [D]storm.
They [Em]coudln't move west and they [C]couldn't go [D]home
Then she saw him [G]ridin' through the rain.
He took [C]charge of the wa[G]gons and he [D]saved the [G]train.
And [Em]she looked down and her [C]heart was [D]gone.
The [Em]train went west but she [C]stayed on [D]in Lone[G]some Dove.

[G]A farmer's daughter with a gentle hand,
[C]A bloom[G]ing rose in [D]a bed of [G]sand.
She [Em]loved the man who [C]wore a [D]star,
A Tex[Em]as Ranger known [C]near and [D]far.
So they got mar[G]ried and they had a child.
But [C]times were [G]tough and [D]West was [G]wild.
So [Em]it was no surprise the [C]day she [D]learned
That [Em]her Texas man would not [C]re[D]turn, to [D]Lone[G]some Dove.

Chorus:
B[Em]ack to back with the [G]Rio Grande, a [C]Christian woman in the d[G]evil's [D/F#]land.
She [Em]learned the language and she [Bm]learned to fight, but she
[C]never learned how to beat the [Am]lonely nights,[D]
In [D]Lone[G]some Dove, [D]Lone[G]some Dove

Verse 3:
[G]She watched her boy grow into a man.
[C]He had an [G]angel's heart and [D]the devil's [G]hand.
He [Em]wore his star for [C]all to [D]see.
He [Em]was a Texas [C]lawman lega[D]cy.
Then one day [G]word blew into town.
It [C]seemed the [G]man that [D]shot his [G]father down
Had [Em]robbed a bank in [C]Jeric[D]ho.
Tho [Em]only thing 'tween them [C]and Mexi[D]co
Was [D]Lone[G]some Dove.

Verse 4:
[G]The shadows stretched across the land
[C]As the shots [G]rang out down the [D]Rio [G]Grande.
And [Em]when the smoke had [C]finally cleared the [D]street,
The [Em]men lay at the [C]ranger's [D]feet.
But legend [G]tells to this very day
That [C]shots were [G]comin' from an [D]alley[G]way.
Though [Em]no one knows who [C]held the [D]gun,
There [Em]ain't no doubt if you [C]ask some[D]one
In [D]Lone[G]some Dove.

Chorus:
B[Em]ack to back with the [G]Rio Grande, a [C]Christian woman in the d[G]evil's [D/F#]land.
She [Em]learned the language and she [Bm]learned to fight, but she
[C]never learned how to beat the [Am]lonely nights,[D]
In [D]Lone[G]some Dove, [D]Lone[G]some Dove
