[D11]I’ve been l[C/G]etting things s[G]lide by me
[D11]And I’ve be[C/G]en trying too h[G]ard to get by too easy
[D11]But this mo[C/G]rning when my r[G]oom was only sunshine
[D11]I think I f[C/G]inally made up [G]my mind

[D11]I’m headed [C/G]back home, agai[G]n
[D11]On this emp[C/G]ty highway[Em][D]
[D11]I’m going take in t[C/G]hat clear A[G]bsaroka air
[Em]And let it[D] take my breath a[D11]way[C/G][G]

[D11]Cuz I’ve ha[C/G]d a hard time b[G]elieving
[D11]In all the [C/G]things that giv[G]e me life
[D11]So I’ve bee[C/G]n trying to fin[G]d some meaning
[D11]Some words [C/G]of wisdom to mo[G]ve my wrongs into rights

[D11]And if fait[C/G]h can move a mo[G]untain
[D11]Tell me wha[C/G]t’s gonna move [Em]my fai[D]th
[D11]But I believe in th[C/G]at clear Ab[G]saroka air
[Em]Cuz it tak[D]es my breath away

[D]Eee  [G]   ee[C/G]e     eee
[D]Eee  [G]   ee[C/G]e     eee
[D]Ahh  [G]   ah[C/G]h     a[Em]hh[D]

[D11] [C/G][G]

Break - 4X

[D]Eee  [G]   ee[C/G]e     eee    (would you ever go home again)
[D]Eee  [G]   ee[C/G]e     eee    (find who you were back then)
[D]Ahh  [G]   ah[C/G]h     a[Em]hh    [D](if I could find the strength to remember all the things I came back for)
