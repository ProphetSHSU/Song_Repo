Verse:
[D]When the rain is blowing [A/C#]in your face,
[Am/C]And the whole world is [G]on your case,
[Gm/Bb]I could offer you a [D/A]warm em[Bm]brace
[Em7]To make you [A7]feel my [D]love

[D]When the evening shadows and the [A/C#]stars appear,
[Am/C]And there is no one to [G]dry your tears,
[Gm/Bb]I could hold you for a [D/A]million [Bm]years
[Em7]To make you [A7]feel my l[D]ove

[G]I know you haven't made your [D/F#]mind up yet,
[F#m]But I would n[G]ever do you w[D]rong.
[G]I've known it from the moment [D/F#]that we met,
[Em7]No doubt in my mind where y[A7sus]ou bel[A]ong

[D]I'd go hungry; I'd go [A/C#]black and blue,
[Am/C]I'd go crawling down the [G]avenue.
[Gm/Bb]There ain’t nothing that I [D/A]wouldn't d[Bm]o
[Em7]To make you [A7]feel my l[D]ove

[G]The storms are raging on the [D/F#]rolling sea
[F#m]Down the h[G]ighway of [D]regret.
[G]The winds of change are blowin’ [D/F#]wild and free,
[Em7]But you ain't seen nothing like me [A7sus]yet[A7][A7sus][A7]

[D]There ain’t nothing that I [A/C#]wouldn’t do,
[Am/C]Go to the ends of the [G]Earth for you,
[Gm/Bb]Make you happy, make your [D/A]dreams come [Bm]true
[Em7]To make you [A7]feel my [D]love
[Em7]To make you [A7]feel my [D]love
