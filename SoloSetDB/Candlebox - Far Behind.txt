Verse:
[G]Now maybe
[Em]I didn't mean to treat you [D]bad
[Cadd9]But I did it anyway
[G]And now maybe
[Em]Some would say your life was [D]sad
[Cadd9]But you lived it anyway
[G]And so maybe
[Em]Your friends they stand around they watch you [D]crumble
[Cadd9]As you falter to the ground
[G]And then someday
[Em]Your friends, they stand beside as you were [D]flyin'
[Cadd9]Oh you were flyin' oh so high
[G]But then someday people look at you [Em]for what they call their own
They watch you [D]suffer
[Cadd9]Yeah they hear you calling home
[G]But then some day we could take our time
[Em]To brush the leaves aside so you can [D]reach us
[Cadd9]But you left me far behind

[G]Now maybe
[Em]I didn't mean to treat you oh so [D]bad
[Cadd9]But I did it anyway

[G]Now maybe [Em]some would say you're left with what you [D]had
[Cadd9]But you couldn't share the pain

[G]No, no, no
[Em]Couldn't share the pain, [D]they watch you suffer
[Cadd9]Mmm hmmm

[G]Now maybe [Em]I could have made my own [D]mistakes
[Cadd9]But I live with what I've known

[G]And then maybe [Em]we might share in something great
[D]But won't you look at where we've grown
[Cadd9]Won't you look at where we've gone

[G]But then someday comes tomorrow holds [Em]a sense of what I feel for you [D]in my mind
[Cadd9]As you trip the final line

[G]And that cold day when you lost control
[Em]Shame you left my life so soon [D]you should have told me
[Cadd9]But you left me far behind

[G]Now maybe [Em]I didn't mean to treat you oh so [D]bad
[Cadd9]But I did it anyway

[G]Now maybe [Em]some would say you're left with what you [D]had
[Cadd9]But you couldn't share the pain no, no, no

Solo:
Oh no, Oh no no no no... Oh my lord,
See I know, See I know*

[G]But maybe, I said maybe [Em]I didn't mean to treat you oh so [D]bad
[Cadd9]But I did it anyway

[G]Sayin' now maybe [Em]some would say you're left with [D]what you had
[Cadd9]But you couldn't share the pain

[G]I said times have changed [Em]your friends
They come and watch you [D]crumble to the ground
[Cadd9]They watch you [G]suffer

Yeah, they hold you down hold you down
[Em]Now maybe brother, maybe love
I didn't mean to [D]treat you bad
But [Cadd9]you left me far behind

Left me far behind
Left me far [G]behind
