[C] [Dm][Em][Dm][C][G]
[C]I'm [Em]sailing a[Am]way,[Am\G\F]
I'm sailing away,
set an open course for the [G]virgin sea
'Cause [C]I've [Em]got to be [Am]free[Am/G],[F]
free to face the life that's a[G]head of me
[Am]On board I'm the captain[G], so climb aboard
[Am]We'll search for tomorrow[G], on every shore
And I'll [C]try, [G]oh Lord, I'll [Am]try,[Am\G\F]
to [G]carry [C]on

[C]C [Dm]Em [Em]   [Dm]   [C]   A[G]m  Am\G\F
I look to the sea,

reflections in the waves spark my [G]memory
[C]Some [Em]happy, some [Am]sad,[Am\G\F]
I think of childhood friends, and the [G]dreams we had
[Am]We lived happily forever[G], so the story goes
[Am]But somehow we missed out[G], on the pot of gold
But we'll [C]try, [G]best that we [Am]can,[Am\G\F]
to [G]carry [C]on

[C]A gathering o[F]f angels,
a[G]ppeared above my [F]head
They [C]sang to me this [F]song of hope,
and [G]this is what they [F]said, they said
[C]Come sail away, [F]come sail away,
come [C]sail away with [F]me, lads
[C]Come sail away, [F]come sail away,
come [C]sail away with [F]me
[C]Come sail away, [F]come sail away,
come [C]sail away with [F]me, lads
[C]Come sail away, [F]come sail away,
come [C]sail away with [F]me

[C]I thought that they wer[F]e angels,
but [G]much to my sur[F]prise;
we [C]climbed aboard their [F]starship,
and [G]headed for the [F]skies
[C]Come sail away, [F]come sail away,
come [C]sail away with [F]me, lads
[C]Come sail away, [F]come sail away,
come [C]sail away with [F]me[C][F][G][F]
