[C][Am][F]

Verse:
I w[C]ake up every [Am]evening[F]
With a big smile on my [C]face
And it [Am]never feels out of p[F]lace
And [C]you're still probably [Am]working[F]
At a 9 to 5 p[C]ace
I wo[Am]nder how bad that ta[F]stes

Chorus:
When you see my [C]face
Hope it gives you h[Am]ell, hope it gives you h[F]ell
When you walk my [C]way
Hope it gives you [Am]hell, hope it gives you he[F]ll

Verse:
Now [C]where's your picket [Am]fence, love?[F]
And where's that shiny [C]car?
And [Am]did it ever get you fa[F]r?
You n[C]ever seemed so t[Am]ense, love[F]
I've never seen you fall so h[C]ard
D[Am]o you know where you [F]are?

Pre-Chorus:
And [G]truth be told, I [Am]miss you
And [G]truth be told, I'm [F7]lying
Chorus:
When you see my [C]face

Hope it gives you [Am]hell, hope it gives you hel[F]l
When you walk my w[C]ay
Hope it gives you [Am]hell, hope it gives you he[F]ll
If you find a [C]man that's worth a [Am]damn and treats you we[F]ll
Then he's a [Am]fool, you're just as w[G]ell
Hope it gives you [F7]hell
I hope it gives you [C]hell[Am][F][C][Am][F]

Bridge:
Now y[Am]ou'll never see
What y[F]ou've done to me

You can [C]take back your memories
They're [Em]no good to m[Dm]e[C]
And h[Am]ere's all your lies
You can l[F7]ook me in the eyes
With the [Dm]sad, sad look
That you w[G]ear so well

When you walk my [Am]way

When you hear this [C]song and you sing along, well, you'll never [F]tell
And you're the [Am]fool, I'm just as [G]well

When you hear this [Am]song I hope that i[G]t will give you h[C]ell
You can sing [Am]along I hope that i[C]t puts you through hell
