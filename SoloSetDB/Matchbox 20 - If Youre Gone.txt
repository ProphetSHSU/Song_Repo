Verse:
[G] I think I've already [C]lost you
[Em] I think you're [D]already [C]gone.
[G] I think I'm finally sc[C]ared now
You think I'm [Am]weak - But I think you're [D]wrong
[G] I think you're already [C]leaving
[Em] Feels like your [D]hand is on the [C]door
[G] I thought this place was an [C]empire
But now I'm re[Am]laxed - I can't be [D]sure

Pre-Chorus:
And I think you're so [Am]mean - I think we should [D]try
I think I could [G]need - this in my [C]life and
I think I'm just [Am]scared - I think too [D]much
I [F]know this is wrong it's a problem I'm dealing

Refrain:
If you're [G]gone - maybe it's time to come [C]home
There's an [Am]awful lot of breathing room[D]
But I can hardly [G]move
If you're [G]gone - baby you need to come [C]home (co[D]me home)
Cuz there's a [Am]little bit of something me[D]
In everything [G]in you[C]
[Em] [C]

Verse:
[G] I bet you're hard to get [C]over
[Em] I bet the[D] room just won't[C]shine
[G] I bet my hands I can [C]stay here
I bet you n[Am]eed - more than you m[D]ind

Pre-Chorus:
And I think you're so [Am]mean - I think we should [D]try
I think I could [G]need - this in my [C]life
I think I'm just [Am]scared - that I know [D]too much
I [F]can't relate and that's a problem. I'm feeling

Refrain:
If you're [G]gone - maybe it's time to come [C]home
There's an [Am]awful lot of breathing room[D]
But I can hardly [G]move
If you're [G]gone - baby you need to come [C]home (co[D]me home)
there's a[Am] little bit of something m[D]e
In everything[G][C]

Bridge:
[Am]in  [D]you
[G][C]
[Am][D]
[G]

Pre-Chorus:
I think you're so [Am]mean - I think we should [D]try
I think I could [G]need - this in my [C]life
I think I'm [Am]scared - do I talk [D]too much
I [F]know it's wrong it's a problem I'm dealing

Refrain:
If you're [G]gone - maybe it's time to go [C]home[D]
There's an [Am]awful lot of breathing [D]room
But I can hardly [G]move
If you're [G]gone - yeah, baby you need to [C]come home ([D]come home)
there's a [Am]little bit of something [D]me
In everything [Am]in... y[D]ou

(everything [Am]in) something [D]me
In [G]you
