Verse:
H[G]ope when you take that [C]jump
You don't fear the [G]fall
H[G]ope when the water [C]rises
You build a [G]wall
H[Em]ope when the crowd screams out
They're screaming yo[C]ur name
H[Em]ope if everybody [C]runs
You choose to sta[G]y

H[G]ope that you fall in [C]love
And it hurts so [G]bad
The [G]only way you can [C]know
Is give it all you [G]have
And I h[Em]ope that you don't suffer,
But take the p[C]ain
H[Em]ope when the moment [C]comes

You'll say...

Chorus:
[G]I, I, I, [C]I did it [G]all,
[G]I, I, I, [C]I did it [G]all,

I [Em]owned every second that this world could give
I saw [C]so many places, the things that I did
Yeah, with [Em]every broken [C]bone
I swear I l[G]ived

Verse:
H[G]ope that you spend your [C]days
But they all add [G]up
And wh[G]en that sun goes [C]down
Hope you raise your [G]cup
I w[Em]ish that I could witness
All your j[C]oy and all your pain
[Em]But until my moment [C]comes

I'll say…

[Chorus]]

[G]I, I, I, [C]I did it [G]all,
[G]I, I, I, [C]I did it [G]all,
I [Em]owned every second that this world could give
I saw [C]so many places, the things that I did
Yeah, with [Em]every broken [C]bone
I swear I l[G]ived

Bridge:
[G]Whooooah,
[G]Whooooah
[Em]Whooooah
[C]Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
with [G]every broken bone

I swear I lived
Yeah, with [G]every broken bone[(stop)]

I swear I lived

[G]I, I, I, [C]I did it [G]all,
[G]I, I, I, [C]I did it [G]all,
I [Em]owned every second that this world could give
I saw [C]so many places, the things that I did
Yeah, with [Em]every broken [C]bone
I swear I l[G]ived
[G]Whooooah,
[G]Whooooah,
[Em]Whooooah,
[C]Oh-oh
