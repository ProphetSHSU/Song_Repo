[Fadd9] [Am7][Gadd11]

Verse:
[Fadd9]      [Am7]    [Gadd11]      
I'm the [C]show in San Antonio[Gadd11]middle of the rodeo?
[Am7]   Daddy's hand that you used to hold 
when you walked[Fadd9]back to the car
[C] I'm a sound of the county fair fer[Gadd11]ris   
wheel kisses high up in the air
[Em]  A sip of brandy when your soul is bare 
and you need[Fadd9]to share your heart

Chorus:
[Am7] [Gadd11] I'm the words[Fadd9]
it'll hit you it'll get you where you're goin' 
so you [Am7]never go there alone[Gadd11]
I'm a me[Fadd9]lody glued to the memory 
that you can't shake[Am7]   
when it comes on[Gadd11]
I'm the part [Fadd9]of you that you listen to 
ridin' in the [Am7]radio all night long[Gadd11]
I'm a song[Fadd9]
Woahoh[Am7]   Woah[Gadd11]
I'm a song[Fadd9]
Woahoh[Am7]   Woah[Gadd11]

Verse:
I was [C]there the day you learned to drive 
[Gadd11]the first time that you got high
[Am7]   I even helped you realize that 
she[Fadd9]wasn't right for you
[C] You fall down I pick you up again 
and helped[Gadd11]a boy become a man
When your best[Em]  friend died 
I helped you cry[Fadd9] and finally turn 'em loose?

Chorus:
[Am7][Gadd11] I'm the words[Fadd9]
it'll hit you it'll get you where you're goin' 
so you [Am7]never go there alone[Gadd11]
I'm a me[Fadd9]lody glued to the memory 
that you can't shake[Am7]
when it comes on[Gadd11]
I'm the part [Fadd9]of you that you listen to 
ridin' in the [Am7]radio all night long[Gadd11]
I'm a song[Fadd9]
