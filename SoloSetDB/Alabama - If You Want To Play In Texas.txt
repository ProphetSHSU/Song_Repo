I re[A]member down in [E]Houston we were [D]puttin' on a [A]show

He said, "We [A]love what you're [E]doin', [D]boys don't get us [A]wrong
There's [A]just somethin' [E]missin' in your [A]songs”

Verse:
So we [A]dusted off our [E]boots and put our [D]cowboy hats on [A]straight
Them [A]Texans raised the [E]roof when Jeff [D]opened up his [E]case
You [A]say y'all all wanna [E]two-step, you [D]say ya wanna do-si-[A]do
Well, [A]here's your fiddlin' [E]song before we [A]go
