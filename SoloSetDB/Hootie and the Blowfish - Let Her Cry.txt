Verse:
[G]She sits alone by a lam[D]-post
[C]Trying to find a thought that's escaped her [G]mind
[G]She says "Dad's the one I love t[D]he most."
[C]But Stipe's not far [G]behind

[G]She never lets me in    [D]only tells me where she's been
[C]when she's had to much to [G]drink
[G]I say that I don't care   I just [D]run my hands through her dark hair
[C]then I pray to God, "You gotta help me fly [G]away"   (and just)

Chorus:
let her [C]cry     if the [G]tears fall down like rain
let her [C]sing    If it [Em]eases [G]all her [D]pain
let her [C]go      let her [G]walk right out on me
and if the [D]sun comes up tomorrow,
let her [C]be,   let her [G]be

Solo:
[G][D][C][G]

Verse:
[G]This morning I woke up alone [D]found a note standing by the phone
[C]saying "maybe, maybe I'll be b[G]ack someday"
[G]I wanted to look for you
you walked [D]in, I didn't know just what I should do
So, I [C]sat back down, had a beer and felt s[G]orry for myself

Chorus:
let her [C]cry     if the [G]tears fall down like rain
let her [C]sing    If it [Em]eases [G]all her [D]pain
let her [C]go      let her [G]walk right out on me
and if the [D]sun comes up tomorrow,
let her [C]be,   let her [G]be

Verse:
(solo over verse)

[G]last night I tried to leave
[D]cried so much I could not beleive
[C]she was the same girl I fell in love with l[G]ong ago

[G]she went in the back to get high
[D]I sat down on my couch and cried yelling
[C]"Whoa Lord whoa, please help m[G]e.  Won't you hold my hand"

Chorus:
let her [C]cry     if the [G]tears fall down like rain
let her [C]sing    If it [Em]eases [G]all her [D]pain
let her [C]go      let her [G]walk right out on me
and if the [D]sun comes up tomorrow, let her [G]be

let her [C]cry     if the [G]tears fall down like rain
let her [C]sing    If it [Em]eases [G]all her [D]pain
let her [C]go      let her [G]walk right out on me
and if the [D]sun comes up tomorrow,
let her [C]be,   let her [G]be
