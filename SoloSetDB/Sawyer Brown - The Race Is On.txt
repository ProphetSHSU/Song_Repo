Intro:
[E]
[E]

Verse:
[E]I feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside
Like m[A]y  heart's sprung[E]a big  break
[E]And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful
[F#m] That I may ne[B]ver shake
You migh[E]t  say that I was taking it hard
Oh, sh[A]e  wrote me off [E]with a  call
[E]But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I m[B]ay  break [A]right d[E]own and  bawl?

Chorus:
Well, the race i[E]s  on
[E]and here comes Pride up the backstretch
[A]Heartaches are going to [E]the in-side
[E]My Tears are holding back
They'r[F#m]e tryin'  no[B]t to fall
[E]My Heart's out of the running
True Love[A]'s  scratched for a[E]nother's  sake
[E]The race is on and it looks like Heartaches
And th[B]e  win[A]ner  l[E]oses  all.

Verse:
[E]One day I ventured in love, never once suspectin'
What th[A]e  final result wo[E]uld be
[E]How I lived in fear of waking up each morning
And thinki[F#m]n' that you're gon[B]e from me
There'[E]s ache and pain in my heart
For today was [A]the one that I [E]hated to face
[E]Somebody new came up to win her
I cam[B]e  out[A] in  s[E]econd  place.

Chorus:
Well, the race i[E]s  on
[E]and here comes Pride up the backstretch
[A]Heartaches are going to [E]the in-side
[E]My Tears are holding back
They'r[F#m]e tryin'  no[B]t to fall
[E]My Heart's out of the running
True Love[A]'s  scratched for a[E]nother's  sake
[E]The race is on and it looks like Heartaches
And th[B]e  win[A]ner  l[E]oses  all.
