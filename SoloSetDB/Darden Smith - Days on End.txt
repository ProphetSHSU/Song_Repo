For days on end
I'm rising up with the sun
For days on end
But I can't get nothing done

Because the world is spinning a little too fast
The sky's been a little too blue
Too many stars at night
And I've been thinking about you

For days on end
Oh these days on end

For days on end
It's like I'm hypnotized
For days on end
I'm just a-laying around the house paralyzed

And the world is spinning a little too fast
The sky's been a little too blue
Too many stars at night
And I've been thinking 'bout you

For days on end
Oh, for days on end
Oh

These days I'm caught between the track and a train
These days I'm like a blind man standing in a pouring rain

And the world is spinning
The sky's been so blue
Too many stars at night
And I've been thinking ‘bout

Oh, how the world is spinning a little too fast
The sky's been a little too blue
Can't count the stars at night
'Cause I've been thinking 'bout you

For days on end
For days on end
For days on end
These days on end
