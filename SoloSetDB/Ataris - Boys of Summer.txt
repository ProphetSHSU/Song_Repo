Intro:
[D#m][B][C#][B]

Verse:
[D#m]Nobody on the road
Nobody on the beach
[B]I feel it in the air
The summer's out of reach
[C#]Empty lake, empty streets
The sun goes down alone
[B]I'm drivin' by your house
Though I know you're not at home

Chorus:
[F#]I can see you
[C#]Your brown skin shinin' the sun
You got your hair combed back and your[B]sunglasses on, baby
[F#]  I can tell you my [C#]love for you will still be strong
After the boys of [B]summer have gone

Bridge 1:
[D#m][B][C#][B]

Verse:
[D#m]I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
[B]Remember how you made me crazy?
Remember how I made you scream
[C#]Now I don't understand what happened to our love
[B]But baby, when I get you back
I'm gonna show you what I'm made of

Chorus:
[F#]I can see you
[C#]Your brown skin shinin' the sun
I see you walkin' real slow, and you're[B]smilin' at everyone
[F#]  I can tell you my [C#]love for you will still be strong
After the boys of [B]summer have gone[B]

Interlude:
[D#m][B][C#][B]

[D#m][B][C#][B]

Verse:
[D#m]Out on the road today, I saw a BLACK FLAG sticker on a Cadillac
[B]A little voice Inside my head said, "Don't look back. You can never look back."
[C#]I thought I knew what love was
What did I know?

[B]Those days are gone forever
I should just let them go but

Chorus:
[F#]I can see you
[C#]Your brown skin shinin' the sun
You got that top pulled down and that[B]radio on, baby
[F#]  I can tell you my [C#]love for you will still be strong
After the boys of [B]summer have gone
[F#]I can see you
[C#]Your brown skin shinin' the sun
You got that hair slicked back and those[B]Wayfarers on, baby
[F#]  I can tell you my [C#]love for you will still be strong
After the boys of [B]summer have gone
