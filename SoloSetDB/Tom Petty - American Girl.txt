Intro:
[D]

Verse:
[D] Well she was an A[E]merican girl
[G] Raised on [A]promises
[D] She couldn't help [E]thinkin' that there
Was a [G]little more to life
[A]Somewhere else
After all it was a [D]great big world
[G] With lots of places to [E]run to
[A]Yeah, if she had to die
Tryin' she had one little promise
She was gonna keep

Chorus:
[G] Oh yeah,[A]all right
[D]Take it easy baby
[Bm]Make it last all night
[G] She was[A] an American [D]girl

Verse:
[D] Well, It was kind of [E]cold that night
[G]She stood alone on her [A]balcony
[D] Yeh, she could hear the [E]cars roll by
Out on [G]four fourty one
Like [A]waves crashin' in on the beach
And for one desperate [D]moment there
[G]He crept back in her [E]memory
[A]God it's so painful
Something that's so close
And still so far out of reach

Chorus:
[G] Oh yeah,[A]all right
[D]Take it easy baby
[Bm]Make it last all night
[G] She was[A] an American [D]girl
