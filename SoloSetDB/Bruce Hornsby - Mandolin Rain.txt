Intro:
[G][D][Am][C]

[G][D][Am][C]

[D]

Verse:
The [G]song came and [D]went,
like the [Am]times that we [C]spent,
hiding [G]out from the [D]rain under the [C]carnival tent[D]
[G]Happen she d [D]smile,
it would [Am]last for a[C]while,
you don't [G]know what you [D]got, till you [C]lose it all a[G]gain[D]

Chorus:
[C]Listen to the [G]mandolin [C]rain,
listen to the [G]music on the [D]lake;
listen to my [Am]heart [C]break, every [G]time she [C]runs a[G]way
[C]Listen to the [G]banjo [C]wind,
a sad song [G]drifting [D]low,
listen to the [Am]tears [C]roll, down my face as she [G]turns to [C]go [D]

Verse:
A [G]cool evening [D]dance,
listening [Am]to the bluegrass [C]band takes the [G]chill
from the [D]air, till they [C]play the last [G]song[D]
[G]I'll do my [D]time,
keeping [Am]you off my [C]mind;
but there's [G]moments that I [D]find, I'm not [C]feeling too [G]strong[D]

Chorus:
[C]Listen to the [G]mandolin [C]rain,
listen to the [G]music on the [D]lake;
listen to my [Am]heart [C]break, every [G]time she [C]runs a[G]way
[C]Listen to the [G]banjo [C]wind,
a sad song [G]drifting [D]low,
listen to the [Am]tears [C]roll, down my face as she [G]turns to [C]go [D]

Bridge:
[F]Running down by the [C]lakeshore,
she did [D]love the [Am]sound of a [C]summer [D]storm
[F]Playing on the lake like a [C]mandolin,
now it's [Am]washing her a[C]way once a[D]gain

Solo:
Verse:
The [G]boat's steaming [D]in,
I [Am]watch the side wheel [C]spin, and
I [G]think about her [D]when I [C]hear the whistle [G]blow[D]
[G]I can't change my [D]mind,
I [Am]knew all the [C]time that she'd [G]go;
but that's a [D]choice I made [C]long a[G]go[D]

Chorus:
[C]Listen to the [G]mandolin [C]rain,
listen to the [G]music on the [D]lake;
listen to my [Am]heart [C]break every [G]time she [C]runs a[G]way
[C]Listen to the [G]banjo [C]wind,
a sad song [G]drifting [D]low;
listen to the [Am]tears [C]roll, down my face as she [G]turns to [C]go [D]
As she turns to [C]go
Listen to, listen to the [G]mandolin [C]rain

Listen to the [Am]tears [C]roll, down my face as she [G]turns to [C]go[D]
Listen to the [Am]tears [C]roll, down my face as she [G]turns to [C]go [D]
Listen to, listen to the [G]mandolin [C]rain
