Intro:
[E] [B/D#][C#m7][A]

Verse:
[E] I hear a [B/D#]lot about si[C#m7]nners[A]
[E] Don't think [B/D#]that I'll be a saint[C#m7][A]
[E] But I might [B/D#]go down to the [C#m7]river[A]
N.C.
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's [F#m7]making me s[B/D#]ay

Chorus:
That the way you [E]hold me, hold me, [B/D#]hold me, hold me, hold me[C#m7][A]
Feels so [E]holy, holy, [B/D#]holy, holy, holy[C#m7],[A]
On God[E]
Runnin' [B/D#]to the altar like a track st[C#m7]ar
Can't wait a[A]nother second
'Cause the way you [E]hold me, hold me, [B/D#]hold me, hold me, hold me
[C#m7]Feels so h[A]oly

Verse:
[E]  I don't [B/D#]do well with the [C#m7]drama[A]
[E]  And no I [B/D#]can't stand it being fa[C#m7]ke
(No, [A]no, no, no, no, no, no)
[E]  I don't [B/D#]believe in nirva[C#m7]na[A]
N.C.
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, [B7sus2]I can't explain

Chorus:
That the way you [E]hold me, hold me, [B/D#]hold me, hold me, hold me[C#m7][A]
Feels so [E]holy, holy, [B/D#]holy, holy, holy[C#m7],[A]
On God[E]
Runnin' [B/D#]to the altar like a track star[C#m7]
Can't wait a[A]nother second
'Cause the way you [E]hold me, hold me, [B/D#]hold me, hold me, hold me
[C#m7]Feels so h[A]oly

Bridge:
[E]  They say we're too [B/D#]young and
The [C#m7]pimps and the players [A]say, "Don't go crushin'"
[E]Wise men say fools [B/D#]rush in
But [C#m7]I don't k[A]now (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
[E]  They say we're too [B/D#]young and
The [C#m7]pimps and the players [A]say, "Don't go crushin'"
[E]Wise men say fools [B/D#]rush in
But [C#m7]I don't k[A]now (Chance the Rapper)

Runnin' to the [B/D#]altar like a track star[C#m7]
Can't wait a[A]nother second, on God[E]
Runnin' to the [B/D#]altar like a track star[C#m7]
Can't wait a[A]nother second, on God[E]
Runnin' to the [B/D#]altar like a track star[C#m7]

'Cause the way you [E]hold me, hold me, [B/D#]hold me, hold me
Feels so [C#m7]ho-ho-ho-holy
