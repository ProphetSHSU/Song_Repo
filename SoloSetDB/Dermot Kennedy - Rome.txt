Verse:
[G]   So, what's the [Em]past for? I'l[C]l need it if love don't last long
You can [G]run around in[Em]finite in my [C]head
[G]   Oh, you [Em]can't see, oh,[C]I'd stay if you asked me
[G]Now you know I care, [Em]but it's hard to tell when you're [C]scared

Pre-Chorus:
But last [D]night
I[Em]t hurt me to hear you say it felt [C]broken
And even though I [D]tried
All these [Em]memories run my mind in slow mo[C]tion

Chorus:
Do you remember w[G]hen
Midnight drives when you'd [D]sing
I'd play you songs you were [Em]in?
I just want to be there ag[C]ain
Do you remember w[G]hen
With Rome below us that [D]day
You said, "I wish we could [Em]stay"?
I just want to be there ag[C]ain

Verse:
[G]   Remembe[Em]r that first laugh? Al[C]l it changed once I had that
[G]Like a hurricane, [Em]but I don't care where I [C]land
[G]   So, dance [Em]carefree, I ho[C]pe it's easier knowing me
[G]Now, your soul is [Em]yours, but I'll help it move if I [C]can

Pre-Chorus:
But last [D]night
I[Em]t hurt me to hear you say it felt [C]broken
And even though I [D]tried
All these [Em]memories run my mind in slow mo[C]tion

Chorus:
Do you remember w[G]hen
Midnight drives when you'd [D]sing
I'd play you songs you were [Em]in?
I just want to be there ag[C]ain
Do you remember w[G]hen
With Rome below us that [D]day
You said, "I wish we could [Em]stay"?
I just want to be there ag[C]ain

Post-Chorus:
Do you remember [G]when, [D]oh
Do you remember [Em]when[C]

Bridge:
[G]   I don't ever wanna l[Em]eave when you cr[C]y
I know I give you reasons to [G]hide
I need you to [Em]stay by my si[C]de
First [C]shootin' star that you ever [G]saw
We were right on our f[Em]eet though, [C]right?
Opening the car door for [G]light
I really thought [Em]I'd lose you that t[D]ime

Chorus:
Do you remember w[G]hen
Midnight drives when you'd [D]sing
I'd play you songs you were [Em]in?
I just want to be there ag[C]ain
Do you remember w[G]hen
With Rome below us that [D]day
You said, "I wish we could [Em]stay"?
I just want to be there ag[C]ain

Post-Chorus:
Do you remember [G]when, [D]oh
Do you remember [Em]when[C]
Do you remember [G]when, [D]oh
Do you remember [Em]when[C]

Outro:
[G,]Ooh,[Em] ah[C]
[G]Ooh, [Em]ooh[C]
