Verse:
[D]You s[D5]ay love is [G]what you put [D]into it
[D]You s[D5]ay that I'm [G]losing my w[D]ill
[D]Don't you k[F#m]now that you're [G]all that I t[D]hink about?
You [G]make up a [D]half of the w[A]hole

[D]You s[D5]ay that it's [G]hard to com[D]mit to it
[D]You s[D5]ay that it's [G]hard standing s[D]till

Counting b[G]ackwards the d[D]ays 'til I'm h[A]ome?

If only New Y[Bm]ork wasn't s[G]o far aw[A]ay
I promise the [Bm]city won't g[G]et in our w[A]ay

And ma[G]ke sure they're[D] shining on [A]you

Just k[G]now that I'm [D]already h[A]ome[G]

Bridge:
[Bm]When life takes[G]it's own course
[Bm]Sometimes we jus[G]t don't get to choose

Wait 'til I'm h[D]ome
