Verse 1:
[C]She calls me from the cold
[D] Just when I was [C]low, 
feeling short of sta[D]ble
[C]And all that she intends
[D] And all she keeps in[C]side, 
isn't on the la[D]bel

Pre Chorus:
[C]She says she's [D]as[Em]hamed
And can [D]she ta[C]ke me for [D]aw[Em]hile?[D]
[C]Can I be a friend,[D] we'll forget the [C]past
Maybe I'm not ab[D]le
And I break at the be[Em]nd

Chorus:
We're here and [Am]now, 
will we [C]ever be a[D]gain
[Am]  'Cause I have [C]found
All that shimmers in this world 
is sure to fade
[C] Awa[D]y aga[C]in

Verse 2:
[D] She [C]dreams a champagne dream
[D] Strawberry sur[C]prise, 
pink linen and white pa[D]per
[C]Lavender and cream
[D] Fields of butter[C]flies, 
reality esca[D]pes her

Pre Chorus:
[C]She says [D]that [Em]love is 
[D]for fo[C]ols who fall[D] be[Em]hind[D]
[C]And I'm somewhere in between
[D] I never really [C]know
A killer from a sa[D]vior
'Til I break at the be[Em]nd

Chorus:
We're here and [Am]now, 
will we [C]ever be a[D]gain
[Am]  'Cause I have [C]found
All that shimmers in this world 
is sure to fade
[C] Awa[D]y aga[C]in[D]
