Verse:
And you as[C]k me what I want this year
And I [F]try to make this kind and clear
Just a ch[G]ance that maybe we'll find better d[C]ays
Cuz I [C]don't need boxes wrapped in strings
And de[F]sire and love and empty things
Just a ch[G]ance that maybe we'll find better d[C]ays

Chorus:
So tak[F]e these words
And si[G]ng out loud
Cuz ev[F]eryone is for[G]given now
Cuz to[Am]night's the night the wo[F]rld begins ag[C]ain[C]

Verse:
And it's som[C]eplace simple where we could live
And som[F]ething only you can give
And thats f[G]aith and trust and peace while we're a[C]live
And the o[C]ne poor child that saved this world
And there's [F]10 million more who probably could
If we a[G]ll just stopped and said a prayer for th[C]em

Chorus:
So tak[F]e these words
And si[G]ng out loud
Cuz ev[F]eryone is for[G]given now
Cuz to[Am]night's the night the wo[F]rld begins ag[C]ain[C]

Solo:
[C] [F][Am][F][C]

Bridge:
I wish eve[C]ryone was loved tonight
And som[F]ehow stop this endless fight
Just a cha[G]nce that maybe we[F]'ll find better da[C]ys

Chorus:
So tak[F]e these words
And si[G]ng out loud
Cuz ev[F]eryone is for[G]given now
Cuz to[Am]night's the night the wo[F]rld begins ag[C]ain[C]

Cuz tonight[Am]'s the night the wo[F]rld begins a[C]gain
