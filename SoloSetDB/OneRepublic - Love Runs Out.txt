Intro:
[E]

Verse:
I'll be your l[Gm]ight, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the br[Gm]ight in black that's makin' you run
And we'll f[Cm]eel alright, and we'll feel alright
'Cause we'll w[Gm]ork it out, yeah we'll work it out
I'll be doin' t[D]his, if you had a doubt
Till the love r[Gm]uns out, till the love runs out

I'll be your g[Gm]host, your game, your stadium
I'll be your [Gm]fifty-thousand clapping like one
And I f[Cm]eel alright, and I feel alright
'Cause I wo[Gm]rked it out, yeah I worked it out
I'll be do[D]in' this, if you had a doubt
Till the l[Gm]ove runs out, till the love runs out

Chorus:
I got my m[Gm]ind made up, man I can't let go
I'm killing e[Gm]very second till it saves my soul
I[Cm]'ll be runnin', I'll be runnin'
Till the lo[Gm]ve runs out, till the love runs out
And we'll st[D]art a fire, and we'll shut it down
Till the l[Gm]ove runs out, till the love runs out
Verse:
There's a m[Gm]aniac out in front of me
Got an an[Gm]gel on my shoulder and Mestopholes
But mama raise[Cm]d me good, mama raised me right
Mama sa[Gm]id "do what you want, say prayers at night"
And I'm sa[D]ying them, 'cause I'm so devout
Till the l[Gm]ove runs out, till the love runs out, yeah

Chorus:
I got my m[Gm]ind made up, man I can't let go
I'm killing e[Gm]very second till it saves my soul
[Cm]I'll be runnin', I'll be runnin'
Till the lo[Gm]ve runs out, till the love runs out
And we'll st[D]art a fire, and we'll shut it down
Till the l[Gm]ove runs out, till the love runs out

Interlude:

[Gm]Ooh[F], [C]we all want the s[Eb]ame thing
[Gm]Ooh[F], [C]we all run for som[Eb]ething
Run for [D]God, for fate
For l[F]ove, for hate
For g[Gm]old, for rust

For diamonds, for dust
I'll be your l[Gm]ight, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the br[Gm]ight in black that's makin' you run

Chorus:
I got my m[Gm]ind made up, man I can't let go
I'm killing e[Gm]very second till it saves my soul
[Cm]I'll be runnin', I'll be runnin'
Till the l[Gm]ove runs out, till the love runs out
And we'll st[D]art a fire, and we'll shut it down
Till the l[Gm]ove runs out, till the love runs out

Outro:
I'll be your l[Gm]ight, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the b[Gm]right in black that's makin' you run
And we'll f[Cm]eel alright, and we'll feel alright
'Cause w[Gm]e'll work it out, yes we'll work it out
And we'll st[D]art a fire, and we'll shut it down
Till the l[Gm]ove runs out, till the love runs out

Till the love runs out
