Verse:
The light in the window is a crack in the sky[G5]
[Db5]A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye[G5]
[Db5]A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back[G5]
[Db5]The man in the dark will bring another attack[G5]

[Db]Your mama [Ebm/Db]told you that you're [Dbm7]not supposed to [A]talk to strangers
[Db]Look in th[Ebm/Db]e mirror, tell me, [Dbm7]do you think your [A]life's in danger? [Eb5]Yea-ah[E5]

Chorus:
No more [Db]tears
No more [Db]tears
No more [Db]tears
No more [Db]tears

Verse:
Another day passes as the night closes in[G5]
[Db5]The red light goes on to say it's time to begin[G5]

[Db]I see the m[Ebm/Db]an around the [Dbm7]corner waiting, [A]can he see me?
[Db]I close my [Ebm/Db]eyes and wait to [Dbm7]hear the [A]sound of someone screaming[Eb5] her[E5]e

No more [Db]tears
No more [Db]tears
No more [Db]tears

Verse:
So now that it's over can't we just say goodbye?[G5]
[Db5]I'd like to move on and make the most of the night[G5]
[Db5]Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way[G5]
[Db5]Your lips are so cold, I don't know what else to say[G5]

[Db]I never [Ebm/Db]wanted it to [Dbm7]end this way, [A]my love, my darling
[Db]Believe me [Ebm/Db]when I say to [Dbm7]you in love I [A]think I'm falling[Eb5] her[E5]e

Chorus:
No more [Db]tears
No more [Db]tears
No more [Db]tears
No more [Db]tears
