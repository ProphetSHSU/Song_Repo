Verse:
[C]I never [F]thought I'd die [Am]alone
I laughed the lo[F]udest who'd have kn[C]own?
I trace the co[F]rd back to the [Am]wall
No wonder it was n[F]ever plugged in at all[C]
I took my t[F]ime, I hurrie[Am]d up
The choice was mi[F]ne I didn't think e[C]nough
I'm too de[F]pressed to go[Am]on
You'll be s[F]orry when I'm go[C]ne

Chorus:
[C]I never con[Dm]quered, rarely c[Am]ame
16 just h[F]eld such better da[C]ys
Days when [Dm]I still felt a[Am]live
We couldn't [F]wait to get outs[C]ide
The world was wi[Dm]de, too late to[Am]try
The tour was [F]over we'd surviv[C]ed
I couldn't wa[Dm]it till I got h[Am]ome
To pass the ti[F]me in my room alo[C]ne

Verse:
[C]I never th[F]ought I'd die al[Am]one
Another six mo[F]nths I'll be unkno[C]wn
Give all my th[F]ings to all my f[Am]riends
You'll never step f[F]oot in my room a[C]gain
You'll close it [F]off, board it [Am]up
Remember the ti[F]me that I spilled the [C]cup
Of apple j[F]uice in the h[Am]all
Please tell m[F]om this is not her f[C]ault

Chorus:
[C]I never co[Dm]nquered, rarely [Am]came
16 just h[F]eld such better da[C]ys
Days when I[Dm] still felt aliv[Am]e
We couldn't [F]wait to get outs[C]ide
The world was wi[Dm]de, too late to tr[Am]y
The tour was [F]over we'd surviv[C]ed
I couldn't wa[Dm]it till I got hom[Am]e
To pass the ti[F]me in my room alo[C]ne

Chorus:
[C]I never con[Dm]quered, rarely c[Am]ame
tomorrow hold[F]s such better d[C]ays
Days when I c[Dm]an still feel al[Am]ive
When I can't wait[F] to get outsid[C]e
The world is wid[Dm]e, the time goes[Am]by
The tour is ov[F]er, I've surviv[C]ed
I can't w[Dm]ait till I get h[Am]ome
To pass the ti[F]me in my room al[C]one
