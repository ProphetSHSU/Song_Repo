Verse:
[C]If you need a friend, don't look to a [Am]stranger,
You know in the [F]end, I'll always be [C]there.
And when you're in doubt, and when you're in [Am]danger,
Take a look all [F]around, and I'll be [C]there.

Chorus:
[C]I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say. (I promise)
[Am]I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be. (I promise)
But [F]if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me,
[C]I promise, I [G]promise you I [C]will.

Verse:
[C]When your day is through, and so is your [Am]temper,
You know what to [F]do, I'm gonna always be [C]there.
Sometimes if I shout, it's not what's [Am]intended.
These words just come [F]out, with no gripe to [C]bear.

Chorus:
[C]I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say. (I promise)
[Am]I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be. (I promise)
But [F]if you wait around a while, I'll make you fall for me,
[C]I promise, I [G]promise you...
[C]I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say. (I promise)
[Am]I know they don't sound the way I planned them to be. (I promise)
And if [F]I had to walk the world, that make you fall for me,
[C]I promise you, I [G]promise you I [C]will.

Verse:
[Am]I gotta tell ya, I need to tell ya, I gotta tell ya, I gotta tell yaaaa ...[F]

[C]I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say. (I promise)

[C]I promise you, I [G]promise you...

Chorus:
[C]I'm sorry, but I'm just thinking of the right words to say. (I promise)

[C]I promise you, I [G]promise you I [C]will ...
[F]I will... I [C]will...
I [C]will...
