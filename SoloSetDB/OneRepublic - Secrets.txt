Intro:
[C][Em/B][Am][F]

Verse:
I need another [C]story
Something to get o[Em/B]ff my chest
My life gets kinda b[Am]oring
Need something that I c[F]an confess

Til' all my s[C]leeves are stained red
From all the t[Em/B]ruth that I've said
Come by it [Am]honestly I swear
Thought you saw a [F]wink, no
I[F]'ve been on the brink, so

Chorus:
Tell me what you [C]want to hear
Something that will l[Em/B]ight those ears
Sick of all the [Am]insincere
So I'm gonna give [F]all my secrets away
[C]  This time, don't need another [Em/B]perfect line
Don't care if critics ever ju[Am]mp in line
I'm gonna give [F]all my secrets away

Verse:
[C]  My god, amazing how we [Em/B]got this far
It's like we're chasing [Am]all those stars
Who's driving shiny [F]big black cars

And ever[C]yday I see the news

All the problems that we could solve 
And when a si[Em/B]tuation rises

Just write it into an album 
Send it st[Am]raight to gold
I don't really l[F]ike my flow, no, so

Chorus:
Tell me what you [C]want to hear
Something that will l[Em/B]ight those ears
Sick of all the [Am]insincere
So I'm gonna give [F]all my secrets away
[C]  This time, don't need another [Em/B]perfect line
Don't care if critics ever ju[Am]mp in line
I'm gonna give [F]all my secrets away

Instrumental:

[C][Em/B][Am][F]

Bridge:
Oooh,[C] got no reason, got not sh[Em/B]ame
Got no family I can [Am]blame
Just don't let me disap[F]pear
[F]I'mma tell you everything

Chorus:
Tell me what you [C]want to hear
Something that will l[Em/B]ight those ears
Sick of all the [Am]insincere
So I'm gonna give [F]all my secrets away
[C]  This time, don't need another [Em/B]perfect line
Don't care if critics ever ju[Am]mp in line
I'm gonna give [F]all my secrets away
[F]All my secrets away, All my secrets away.
