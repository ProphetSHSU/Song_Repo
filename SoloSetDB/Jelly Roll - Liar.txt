Intro:
[Am]

Verse 1:
[Am]I, I let you drive around my [C]mind
I can't count the times you 
[Dm]made me feel like I'm nothing
Played [F]me like a fool,[E] like a fool

Pre-Chorus:
Saying, "Drink[Am]  another whiskey
Pop another pill
Mon[C]ey makes you happy
Heaven isn't real
You[Dm]  won't find nobody to love
Because your [F]heart's too broke"[E]
Now I know
You ain't nothin' but a [Am]liar

Chorus:
Yeah, I walk right out the [C]fire
Yeah, you try to keep me [F]down
Try to put me underground
But I'm only going [E]higher
I can hear you in my [Am]head
In my bed when I'm dreamin'
You try to be my [C]friend
But you're blowin' smoke
Oh, and now,[F] I ain't scared of
Tellin' you where you can go[E]
'Cause I know
You're nothing but a [Am]liar

Verse 2:
You burned me one too many [C]times
Like a devil in dis[Dm]guise, 
hiding your true colors
Just [F]leave me alone[E]
Keep leading me on

Pre-Chorus:
Saying, "Drink[Am]  another whiskey
Pop another pill
Mon[C]ey makes you happy
Heaven isn't real
You[Dm]  won't find nobody to love
Because your [F]heart's too broke"[E]
Now I know
You ain't nothin' but a [Am]liar

Chorus:
Yeah, I walk right out the [C]fire
Yeah, you try to keep me [F]down
Try to put me underground
But I'm only going [E]higher
I can hear you in my [Am]head
In my bed when I'm dreamin'
You try to be my [C]friend
But you're blowin' smoke
Oh, and now,[F] I ain't scared of
Tellin' you where you can go[E]
'Cause I know
You're nothing but a [Am]liar

Solo:
[C]  [F]  [E] If I was 
[Am]doin' what you do

Bridge:
Then you would [F]swear I poisoned [E]you
You're nothin' but a [Am]liar

Chorus:
Yeah, I walk right out the [C]fire
Yeah, you try to keep me [F]down
Try to put me underground
But I'm only going [E]higher

In my bed when I'm dreamin'
You try to be my [C]friend
But you're blowin' smoke

Tellin' you where you can go[E]
'Cause I know
You're nothing but a liar
