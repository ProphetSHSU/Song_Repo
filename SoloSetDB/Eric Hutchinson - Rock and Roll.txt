Intro:
[G][B7][C][A7]
[G][B7][C][A7]

Verse:
He’s be[G]en waiting around for the wee[B7]kend
Figuring which club to sn[C]eak in
Fancy dr[A7]inks and fifty-dollar cover ch[G]arge
Lately it’s been a big h[B7]assle
Heineken and New C[C]astle
So make s[A7]ure he’s fitting in and living larg[Bm]e

Disr[Am]egard the l[C]ies that he will tell
and what he’s pro[D]bably like 'cause
[Bm]It's not h[Am]ard his c[C]harm is gonna
Get him th[D]rough the night

Chorus 1:

[C9]If he wants to r[G]ock he rocks
[D]If he wants to r[G]oll he rolls
[C9]He can r[G]oll with the punches
[D]Long as he feels like [G]he’s in control
[C9]If he wants to s[G]tay he stays
[D]If he wants to [G]go he goes
[C9]He doesn’t c[G]are how he gets there
[D]Long as he gets som[G]ewhere he knows, oh no

[C9]na na [G]na na na [D]na na [G]na na
[C9]na na [G]na na na [D]na na [G]na na

Verse:
[G]See her heavy make up and cut t-s[B7]hirt
Every girl out wants to [C]be her
But they l[A7]ook the same already why adjust
[G]Reading the magazine sec[B7]rets
Forgetting the topical re[C]grets
If she co[A7]mes home all alone the nights a b[Bm]ust

It’s a [Am]must the sw[C]ivel in her hips
And the l[D]ook she gives
[Bm]It’s all her t[Am]rust if o[C]nly in the morning
She knew where she li[D]ved

Chorus 2:
[C9]If she wants to [G]rock she rocks
[D]If she wants to [G]roll she rolls
[C9]She can [G]roll with the punches
[D]Long as she feels like[G]she’s in control
[C9]If she wants to [G]stay she stays
[D]If she wants to[G]go she goes
[C9]She doesn’t [G]care how she gets there
[D]Long as she gets so[G]mewhere she knows, oh no

[C9]na na [G]na na na [D]na na [G]na na

Verse:
[Am]And in a wink[F] they’re on the brink               
F[G]rom drink to d[C]rink and at the [C/B]bar With cash to blow
From s[Am]hot to shot it’s get[F]ting hot
Ad[G]vance the plot to s[C]ee how far
It’s g[Am]onna go
Al[F]l depends so di[G]tch the friends
And g[C]rab a cab
Another ch[Am]ance for cheap romance
D[F]oesn’t count cause the ro[G]om is spinning
Nothing to l[C]ose tonight they b[Bm7]oth a[Bbm7]re wi[Am]nning
And they f[C]all in love as they f[D]all in bed

They sing...

Chorus 3:

[C9]If they want to [G]rock they rock
[D]If they want to [G]roll they roll
[C9]They can[G]roll with the punches
[D]Long as they feel like[G]they’re in control
[C9]If they want to [G]stay they stay
[D]If they want to[G]go they go
[C9]They doesn’t[G]care how they get there
[D]Long as they get so[G]mewhere they know, oh no
