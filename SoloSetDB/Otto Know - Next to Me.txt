Intro:
[Em][C][G][Dsus]

[Em]As a kid they told me love was m[C]ade up
[G]But I used to tell them they were wrong[Dsus4]
[Em]'Cause the blue-eyed girl that made me w[C]ake up
[G]Stayed right by me in this song[Dsus4]
[Em]I stood there counting every h[C]ear[(alternative]tbeat[pause)]
[G]Thinking about the words to say[Dsus4]
[Em]Trying not to understand that f[C]eeling
[G]Would it ever go a[G]way?

Now [C]those were the [G]days
Before you [Em]had to go a[A]way
Now I'm [C]dancing by m[G]yself out in the [D]ra-a-a-a-in
Now it's [C]getting rather [G]cold
And I just [Em]wanted you to [A]know
That if my [C]dreams will ever [G]be
Will you come [D]dancing next to me

[Em]You told me we would be f[C]orever
[G]But maybe we were just too young[Dsus4]
[Em]I wonder if you still [C]remember
[G]When we were dancing in the [G]sun

Now [C]those were the [G]days
Before you [Em]had to go a[A]way
Now I'm [C]dancing by m[G]yself out in the[Dsus4]ra-a-a-a-in
Now it's [C]getting rather [G]cold
And I just [Em]wanted you to [A]know
That if my [C]dreams will ever [G]be
Will you come [D]dancing next to me
