Intro:
[Gm]
[Cm] [D]

Verse 1:
[Gm]White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
[Cm]Creepin' around like no one knows
[D]Think you're so criminal
[Gm]Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do [Cm]what I want when I'm wanting to
[D]My soul? So cynical
So you're a [Gm]tough guy

Chorus:
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that [Cm]bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend [D]mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

Bridge:
[Gm]  I'm the [Cm]bad guy[D]

Verse 2:
[Gm]I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
[Cm]Own me, I'll let you play the role
[D]I'll be your animal
[Gm]My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
[Cm]If she reads all the lyrics
She'll [D]pity the men I know
So you're a [Gm]tough guy

Chorus:
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that [Cm]bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend [D]mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

Bridge:
[Gm]  I'm the [Cm]bad guy,[D] duh[Gm]
I'm only good at bein' [Cm]bad, [D]bad

Interlude:
[Gm]  I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause 
I'm wearing your cologne

Outro:
[Gm]  I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
