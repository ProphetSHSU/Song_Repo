Intro:
[C]Ah, ah ah [Am]ah
Ah ah [F]ah ah, ah ah [C]ah

Verse:
Oh[C]her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shining
[Am]Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying
[F] She's so beautiful, and I tell her every[C]day

Yeah,[C]I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
[Am]And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
[F] But every time she asks me do I look okay, I [C]say

Chorus:
When I see your [C]face, there's not a [Am]thing that I would change
Cause you're a[F]mazing, just the way you [C]are
And when you [C]smile, the whole world [Am]stops and stares for a while
Cause girl you're a[F]mazing, just the way you [C]are, (yeah)

Verse:
[C]Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
[Am]Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
[F] She's so beautiful, and I tell her every [C]day

Oh, you [C]know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If [Am]perfect is what you're searching for, then just stay the same
[F]So, don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll [C]say

Chorus:
When I see your [C]face, there's not a [Am]thing that I would change
Cause you're a[F]mazing, just the way you [C]are
And when you [C]smile, the whole world [Am]stops and stares for a while
Cause girl you're a[F]mazing, just the way you [C]are

Interlude:

The way you [C]are, the way you [Am]are
Girl you're a[F]mazing, just the way you [C]are

Chorus:
When I see your [C]face, there's not a [Am]thing that I would change
Cause you're a[F]mazing, just the way you [C]are
And when you [C]smile, the whole world [Am]stops and stares for a while
Cause girl you're a[F]mazing, just the way you [C]are
