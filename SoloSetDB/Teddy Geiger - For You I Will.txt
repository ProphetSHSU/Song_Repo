Intro:
[E/C#][B][A]
[E/C#][B][A]

Verse:
[E/C#]Wandering the streets, [B]in a world underneath it all[A]
[E/C#]Nothing seems to be, [B]nothing tastes as sweet as what [A]I can't have
A[E/E][E/D#]
Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair round your finger
[E/C#]Tonight I'm not afraid to [B]tell you
[F#]What I feel about you.

Chorus:
Oh I'm gonna [A]muster every ounce of confidence I[B]have
and [E/E]cannon ball [E/D#]into the w[F#]ater
I'm gonna [A]muster every ounce of confidence I[B]have
For [E/C#]you  [B]I [A]will
For [E/C#]you  [B]I [A]will

Verse:
[E/C#]Forgive me if I st-stutter, [B]from all of the clutter in my h[A]ead
[E/C#]Cause I could fall asleep in those [B]eyes, l[A]ike a water bed
Do [E/E]I seem familiar, I've [E/D#]crossed you in hallways a [A]thousand times
[E/C#]No more camouflage, I want to [B]be exposed
And [F#]not be afraid to fall.

Chorus:
Oh I'm gonna [A]muster every ounce of confidence I[B]have
and [E/E]cannon ball [E/D#]into the w[F#]ater
I'm gonna [A]muster every ounce of confidence I[B]have
For [E/C#]you  [B]I [A]will
[A]You always want what you can't [B]have
[E/E]But I'[E/D#]ve  got to [F#]try
I'm gonna [A]muster every ounce of confidence I [B]have
For [E/C#]you  [B]I [A]will
For [E/C#]you  [B]I [A]will
For [E/C#]you  [B]I [A]will

Verse:
     E* B* A* F#* (x2)
For you...
[E*]If I could dim the lights [B*]in the mall
[A*]And create a [F#*]mood
[E*]  I [B*]would[A*][F#*]

[E*]Shout out your [B*]name so it [A*]echoes in every [F#*]room
[E*]  I [B*]would[A*][F#*]
[E*]   [B*]   [A*]   [F#*]F#
That's what I'd do
[A] That's what I'd do, to get through to [E/C#]you, [B]yeah

Chorus/Outro:
Oh I'm gonna [A]muster every ounce of confidence I[B]have
and [E/E]cannon ball [E/D#]into the [F#]water
I'm gonna [A]muster every ounce of confidence I[B]have
For [E/C#]you  [B]I [A]will
[A]You always want what you can't [B]have
[E/E]But I'[E/D#]ve  got to [F#]try
I'm gonna [A]muster every ounce of confidence I [B]have
For [E/C#]you  [B]I [A]will
For [E/C#]you  [B]I [A]will
For [E/C#]you  [B]I [A]will
For [E/C#]you  [B]I [A]will...
