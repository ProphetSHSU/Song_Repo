[D] [Em] [Fm]

[Fm] [Am] [G]

Chorus:
If I [Am]can't be [F]close to you
[C] I'll settle [G]for the ghost of you
[Am]  I miss [F]you more than life [C] [G]

Verse:
[Am]Youngblood thinks [F]there's always tomorrow
[C]  [G] I [Am]miss your touch [F]on nights when I'm hollow
[C]  [G] I [Am]know you cross the bridge [F]that I can't follow
[C]  [G] Since the [Dm]love that you [Em]left is [F]all that I get
I [F]want you[Am]  to [G]know that

Chorus:
If I [Am]can't be [F]close to you
[C] I'll settle [G]for the ghost of you
[Am]  I miss [F]you more than life
[C]  [G] And if you [Am]can't be [F]next to me
[C] Your memo[G]ry is ecstasy
[Am]  I miss [F]you more than life
[C] I miss [G]you more than life

Verse:
[Am]Youngblood thinks [F]there's always tomorrow
[C]  [G] I [Am]need more time, [F]but time can't be borrowed
[C]  [G] I'd [Am]leave it all behind [F]if I could follow
[C]  [G] Since the [Dm]love that you [Em]left is [F]all that I get
I [F]want you[Am]  to [G]know that

Chorus:
If I [Am]can't be [F]close to you
[C] I'll settle [G]for the ghost of you
[Am]  I miss [F]you more than life[C][G]
And if you [Am]can't be [F]next to me
[C] Your memo[G]ry is ecstasy
[Am]  I miss [F]you more than life
[C] I miss [G]you more than life

Post-Chorus:
[Am]   [F]Woah
[C]  [G]Na, nana
[Am]   [F] More than life[C][G]

Chorus:
So If I [Am]can't be [F]close to you
[C] I'll settle [G]for the ghost of you
[Am]  I miss [F]you more than life
[C]  [G] And if you [Am]can't be [F]next to me
[C] Your memo[G]ry is ecstasy
[Am]  I miss [F]you more than life
[C] I miss [G]you more than life

And if you [Am]can't be [F]next to me
[C] Your memo[G]ry is ecstasy
[Am]  I miss [F]you more than life
[C] I miss [G]you more than life

{c: chill outtro}
So If I [Am]can't be [F]close to you

[Am]  I miss [F]you more than life
