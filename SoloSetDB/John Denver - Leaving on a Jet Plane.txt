Intro:
[D]

Verse:
All my [G]bags are packed, I'm [C]ready to go
I'm [G]standing here outs[C]ide your door
I [G]hate to wake you [C]up to say good[D]bye
But the [G]dawn is breaking, it's[C]early morn,
The [G]taxi's waiting, he's [C]blowing his horn
Al[G]ready I'm so lone[C]some I could [D]die

Chorus:
So [G]kiss me and [C]smile for me
[G]Tell me that you'll [C]wait for me
[G]Hold me like you'll [C]never let me g[D]o
I'm [G]leaving [C]on a jet plane
[G]   Don't know when [C]I'll be back again
[G]  Oh b[C]abe, I hate to [D]go

Verse:
There's so [G]many times I've [C]let you down
So [G]many times I've [C]played around
I [G]tell you now [C]they don't mean a [D]thing
Every [G]place I go I'll [C]think of you
Every [G]song I sing I'll [C]sing for you
When [G]I come back I'll [C]bring your wedding [D]ring

Chorus:
So [G]kiss me and [C]smile for me
[G]Tell me that you'll [C]wait for me
[G]Hold me like you'll [C]never let me g[D]o
I'm [G]leaving [C]on a jet plane
[G]   Don't know when [C]I'll be back again
[G]  Oh b[C]abe, I hate to [D]go

Verse:
[G]Now the time has [C]come to leave you
[G]One more time [C]let me kiss you
Then [G]close your eyes [C]I'll be on my [D]way
[G]Dream about the [C]days to come
When [G]I won't have to [C]leave alone
A[G]bout the times [C]I won't have to [D]say

Chorus:
So [G]kiss me and [C]smile for me
[G]Tell me that you'll [C]wait for me
[G]Hold me like you'll [C]never let me [D]go
I'm [G]leaving [C]on a jet plane
[G]   Don't know when [C]I'll be back again
[G]  Oh babe, [C]I hate to [D]go
