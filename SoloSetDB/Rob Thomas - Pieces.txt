Intro:
[Dm] [Bb][F][C]

[Dm]Run away, run [Bb]away if you can't speak
[F]Turn a page on a [C]world that you don't need
[Dm]Wide awake and you're [Bb]scared that you won't come [F]down n[C]ow

Didn't I [Dm]tell you you were gonna [Bb]break down
Didn't I [F]warn you, didn't I [C]warn you
Better take it [Dm]easy, try to find a [Bb]way out
Better start be[F]lieving in your[C]self

[F] We build it [C]up, we tear it [Dm]down
We leave our [Bb]pieces on the [F]ground
We see no [C]end, we don't know [Dm]how
We are [Bb]lost and we're falling

[Dm]Hold onto [Bb]me
You're all I [F]have, all I [C]have
[Dm]Hold onto [Bb]me
You're all I [F]have, all I [C]have

[Dm]Now and then there's a [Bb]light in the darkness
[F]Feel around till you [C]find where your heart went
[Dm]There's a weight in the [Bb]air but you can't see [F]why, wh[C]y

Didn't I [Dm]tell you you were gonna [Bb]break down
Didn't I [F]want you, everybody [C]wants you
Tell me what you're [Dm]needing, give into your [Bb]bleeding
Never any [F]feeling for yours[C]elf

[F] We build it [C]up, we tear it [Dm]down
We leave our [Bb]pieces on the [F]ground
We see no [C]end, we don't know [Dm]how
We are [Bb]lost and we're falling

[Dm]Hold onto [Bb]me
You're all I [F]have, all I [C]have
[Dm]Hold onto [Bb]me
You're all I [F]have, all I [C]have
