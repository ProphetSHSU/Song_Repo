Intro:
[Em][C][D][C]

Verse:
[Em]Nobody on the road, nobody on the beach.
[C]I feel it in the air, the summer's out of reach.
[D]Empty lake, empty streets, the sun goes down alone.
[C]I'm driving by your house, though I know your not home.

Chorus:
[G]But I can see you,[D]your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair combed back and you[C]r sunglasses on, baby.
[G]I can tell you my [D]love for you will still be strong
After the boys of [C]summer have gone.

Verse:
[Em]I never will forget those nights, I wonder if it was a dream.
[C]Remember how you made me crazy, remember how I made you scream.
[D]Now I don't understand what happened to our love.
B[C]ut, baby, when I get you back, I'm gonna show you what I'm made of.

Chorus:
[G]But I can see you,[D]your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair combed back and you[C]r sunglasses on, baby.
[G]I can tell you my [D]love for you will still be strong
After the boys of [C]summer have gone.

Verse:
[Em]Out on the road today I saw a Black Flag Sticker on a Cadillac.
[C]A little voice inside my head said: "Don't look back, you can never look back."
[D]I thought I knew what love was. What did I know?
[C]Those days are gone forever, I should just let them go, but

Chorus:
[G]But I can see you,[D]your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair combed back and you[C]r sunglasses on, baby.
[G]I can tell you my [D]love for you will still be strong
After the boys of [C]summer have gone.
[G]But I can see you,[D]your brown skin shining in the sun.
You got your hair combed back and you[C]r sunglasses on, baby.
[G]I can tell you my [D]love for you will still be strong
After the boys of [C]summer have gone.
