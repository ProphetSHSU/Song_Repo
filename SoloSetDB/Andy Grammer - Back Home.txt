Verse:
[G]I'm gonna need you to [Cadd9*]raise your [G]glass
I don't care what you [D*]put in [G]it
Here's to nights that you [Cadd9*]can't take [G]back
We live hard but we [D*]love to [Em7]laugh

[G]We all thought that we'd [Cadd9*]get  rich [G]fast
Hop the plane out for [D*]greener [G]grass
Found out the [Cadd9*]green is [G]cash
Don't compare to the [D*]friends that [Em7]last

Pre-Chorus:
See, [G]we won't for[Am]get where we [Em]came from
The [C]city won't [G]change us
We [Am]beat to the [Em]same drum[C]
No, w[G]e won't for[Am]get where we [Em]came from
The [C]city can't [G]change us
We [Am]beat to the [Em]same drum, the [C]sa[-once]me drum (Hey!)

[G]La-dah-dah-dah-dah-[Cadd9*]dah-dah-[G]dah

We always find our [D*]way back [G]home (Hey!)

[G]La-dah-dah-dah-dah-[Cadd9*]dah-dah-[G]dah
La-dah-dah-dah-dah-[D*]dah-dah-[G]doe (Hey!)
And no matter where [Cadd9*]we     [G]go
We always find our [D*]way back [G*]home

Verse:
[G]So here's to the [Cadd9*]cheap sung[G]lasses
Redbull and [D*]mini[G]vans and
People who [Cadd9*]had your [G]back when
The world didn't [D*]under[G]stand[-stop]
Pre-Chorus:
See, [G]we won't for[Am]get where we [Em]came from
The [C]city won't [G]change us

The [C]city can't [G]change us
We [Am]beat to the [Em]same drum, the [C]sa[-once]me drum (Hey!)

When [G]ties loosen
[D/F#]We're losin' [Em7]touch

To the [Am]same [G]damn [D/F#]thing[-once]s

[G]Oh no, the [Am]city won't [Em]change us [C][-once]
Won't change us (Hey!)

[G]La-dah-dah-dah-dah-[Cadd9*]dah-dah-[G]dah
La-dah-dah-dah-dah-[D*]dah-dah-[G]doe
                    Cadd9* G -once
And no matter where we     go
