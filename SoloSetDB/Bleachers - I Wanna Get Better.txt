VERSE:
Hey,[G/C] I hear the voice of a [G]preacher from the back room
[F]Calling my name and I [G]follow just to find you
[G/C]I trace the faith to a [G]broken down television[F] and put on the [G]weather
An[G/C]d I've trained myself to [G]give up on the past 'cause
I [F]frozen time between [G]hearses and caskets
[G/C]Lost control when I[G]panicked at the acid test

[F]I wanna get [G]better

While my [G/C]friends were getting high and[G] chasing girls down [F]parkway lines
I was l[G]osing my mind 'cause the [G/C]love, the love, the love, the[G]love, the love
That I[F] gave [G]wasted on a nice face
[G/C]In a blaze of fear[G] I put a helmet on a[F]helmet
Counting seconds through the[G] night and got carried away[G/C]
So now I'm s[G]tanding on the overpass [F]screaming at the cars,
[G]"Hey, I wanna get better!"

CHORUS:
[G/C]I didn’t know[G] I was lo[F]nely 'til I [G]saw your face
[G/C]I wanna get [G]better, [F]better, better, [G]better,
I wanna get better
[G/C]I didn't know[G] I was br[F]oken 'til I w[G]anted to change
[G/C]I wanna get [G]better, [F]better, better, [G]better,
I wanna get better

VERSE:
Repeat Verse Method:
[G/C]I go up to my room and there's [G]girls on the ceiling
[F]Cut out their pictures and I [G]chase that feeling
Of an [G/C]eighteen year old who [G]didn't know what loss was
[F]Now I'm a [G]stranger

[G/C]And I miss the days of a [G]life still permanent
[F]Mourn the years b[G]efore I got carried away
[G/C]  So now I'm sta[G]ring at the interstate[F]screaming at myself,
[G]"Hey, I wanna get better!"

Chorus:
BRIDGE:
[D]  'Cause I'm [A]sleeping in the back of a[G]taxi
I'm s[A]creaming from my bedroom [D]window
[A]Even if its gonna [G]kill me

VERSE:
[G/C]Woke up this morning [G]early before my family
[F]From this dream where [G]she was trying to show me
[G/C]How a life can mo[G]ve from the darkness
[F]She said to get [G]better

[G/C] So I put a bullet where I [G]shoulda put a helmet
And I[F] crash my car cause I [G]wanna get carried away
[G/C]That's why I'm s[G]tanding on the overpass s[F]creaming at myself,
[G]"Hey, I wanna get better!"

Chorus:
