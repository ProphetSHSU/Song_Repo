Verse:
Life's [G]like the road that you travel on
There's [D]one day here and the next day gone
Some[A]times you bend, sometimes you stand
Some[A]times you turn your back to the wind
There's a [G]world outside every darkened door
Where [D]blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the [A]brave are free and lovers soar,
Come [A]ride with me to the distant shore
[Bm]  We won't hesitate [A]to break down the garden gate
[G]  There's not much time left to-[E]day

Chorus:
[Bm]Life is[A] a h[G]ighway, I w[A]anna [D]ride it
all [G]nigh[D]t l[A]ong[G][D][A]
If [Bm]you're g[A]oing [G]my way, I w[A]anna [D]drive it
all [G]nigh[D]t l[A]ong[G][D][A]

Verse:
Through [G]all these cities, and all these towns
It's [D]in my blood and in it's all around
I [A]love you now, like I loved you then;
[A]This is the road, and these are the hands
From [G]Mozambique to those memphis nights
The [D]Khyber Pass to Vancouver's Lights
[A]Knock me down and back up again
You're [A]in my blood, I'm not a lonely man
[Bm]  There's no load that I can hold,  [A]road's so rough, this I know
[G]I'll be there when the light comes in
Just [E]tell 'em we're survivors

Double Chorus:
[Bm]Life is[A] a h[G]ighway, I w[A]anna [D]ride it   all [G]nigh[D]t l[A]ong[G][D][A]

Bridge:
[Em]   There was a [G]distance between [Bm]you and I    [A]between you and [Em]I
A misunder[G]standing once, but [Bm]now we look it in the [A]eye[A]
