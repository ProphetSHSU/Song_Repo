Verse:
[Am]I don't like walk[Fmaj7]ing around this [C]old and empty house
So h[Am]old my hand, I'll w[F]alk with you my d[C]ear
The s[Am]tairs creak a[Fmaj7]s I sleep, it's [C]keeping me awake
It's the h[Am]ouse telling y[F]ou to close your e[C]yes
[Am]Some days I [Fmaj7]can't even [C]trust myself
It's ki[Am]lling me to s[F]ee you this w[C]ay

Verse:
There's an o[Am]ld voice [Fmaj7]in my head that's[C]holding me back

We u[Am]sed to play out[Fmaj7]side when we were yo[C]ung (and full of life and full of love)
[Am]Some days [Fmaj7]I don't know if [C]I am wrong or right
Your m[Am]ind is playing [Fmaj7]tricks on you my d[C]ear

[Am]The screams all [Fmaj7]sound the s[C]ame. H[G]ey!

This[C] ship will c[G]arry
Our bo[Am]dies [Fmaj7]safe to s[C]hore[G]

Now we're t[Am]orn, torn, torn apart, there's nothing we can do.
Just [Am]let me go, we'll meet again soon.

I [Am]see you when I[Fmaj7] fall as[C]leep. H[G]ey!
