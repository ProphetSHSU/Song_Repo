Verse:
[Cmaj7]Listen, everyone
[Cadd9]The time will come when all of us say[G]goodbye

But we're [Cmaj7]never really gone
[Cadd9]As long as there's a memory [G]in your mind

Chorus:
So now [Em]go do the [D/F#]best things in lif[G]e
Take a [C]bite of this world while you[B7]can

Make a [C]ride of this world while you [D]can

Verse:
[Cmaj7]Take the ones you love
[Cadd9]And hold them close because there [G]is little time
And don't[Cmaj7]let it break your heart

But they're [Cmaj7]never really gone
[Cadd9]As long as there's a memor[G]y in your mind

So now [Em]go do the [D/F#]best things in l[G]ife
