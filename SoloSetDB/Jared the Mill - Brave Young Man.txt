Intro: 
[Cadd9][Dsus4][G]
[Cadd9][Dsus4][G]

[Cadd9]Going South on a [Dsus4]North-bound tr[G]ain
[Cadd9]With all the emptiness and n[Dsus4]othing that I've ga[G]ined
[Cadd9]Pocket's full of sand and [Dsus4]gravel in my b[G]oots
I'm a b[Em]rave young man, and I've got n[Dsus4]othing left to l[G]ose

[Cadd9]Giving more than what you've[Dsus4] got can get you ki[G]lled
[Cadd9]But all the same I thrive on lo[Dsus4]neliness and thr[G]ills
[Cadd9]I've taken shots that left me s[Dsus4]leeping in the d[G]ust
I'm a b[Em]rave young man, and I've got [Dsus4]little more than l[G]ust

[Dadd4/F#]But I've traveled [Em]far [Dsus4]away to pl[G]aces I've not [Cadd9]been before
And I[Em]'ve lost [Dsus4]words to s[G]ay[Cadd9]
Pre[Em]aching to [Dsus4]those who hate my to[G]ngue[Dadd4/F#][Cadd9]
I'm a [Em]man who's [Dsus4]brave and young

[Cadd9][Dsus4][G]
[Cadd9][Dsus4][G]

[Cadd9]I've given into [Dsus4]darker th[G]ings
[Cadd9]Back when my head was [Dsus4]strong but my mind was w[G]eak
[Cadd9]I've spoken out amongst a [Dsus4]crowd of sleeping do[G]ves
[Em]I'm a brave young man, but I don't [Dsus4]know where I be[G]long

[Dadd4/F#]But I've traveled [Em]far [Dsus4]away to pl[G]aces I've not [Cadd9]been before
And I[Em]'ve lost [Dsus4]words to s[G]ay[Cadd9]
Pre[Em]aching to [Dsus4]those who hate my to[G]ngue[Dadd4/F#][Cadd9]
I'm a [Em]man who's [Dsus4]brave and young

[Cadd9][Dsus4][G]
[Cadd9][Dsus4][G]

[Cadd9][Dsus4][G]
[Cadd9][Dsus4][G]
[Cadd9][Dsus4][G]

[Dadd4/F#]I've traveled [Em]far [Dsus4]away to pl[G]aces I've not [Cadd9]been before
And I[Em]'ve lost [Dsus4]words to s[G]ay[Cadd9]
Pre[Em]aching to [Dsus4]those who hate my to[G]ngue[Dadd4/F#][Em]
I'm a[Cadd9] man who's [Dsus4]brave and young

[Cadd9][Dsus4][G]
[Cadd9][Dsus4][G]

[Cadd9]I've told myself that I'm a [Dsus4]better man than m[G]ost
[Cadd9]But too my friends I'm as se[Dsus4]e-through as a gh[G]ost
[Cadd9]They tell me what I need and[Dsus4] beg me not to s[G]tay
But I'm a b[Em]rave young man, and I've got n[Dsus4]othing left to [G]say
