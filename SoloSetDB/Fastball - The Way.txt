Intro:
[F#m]

Verse 1:
They [F#m]made up their minds
And they started [Bm]packing
They [C#7]left before the sun came up that d[F#m]ay
An [F#7]exit to eternal summer s[Bm]lacking
But [F#m]where were they going with[C#7]out ever knowing the [F#m]way

Verse 2:
They [F#m]drank up the wine
And they got to [Bm]talking
They [C#7]now had more important things to s[F#m]ay
And [F#7]when the car broke down they started w[Bm]alking
Where [F#m]were they going with[C#7]out ever knowing the [F#m]way
[E] Anyone can see the [A]road that they walk on

Chorus:
Is [E]paved with gold
I[F#m]t's always summer
They'll [C#7]never get cold
They'll [D]never get hungry
They'll [A]never get old aand g[E]rey
You can see their [A]shadows wandering [E]off somewhere
They [F#m]won't make it home
But they [C#7]really don't care
They [D]wanted the highway
They[A]re happier there to[E]day
To[C#7]day

Verse 3:
[F#m]Their children woke up
And they couldn't [Bm]find them
They'd [C#7]left before the sun came up that d[F#m]ay
They [F#7]just drove off and left it all behind [Bm]them
But [F#m]where were they going [C#7]without ever knowing the [F#m]way
[E] Anyone can see the [A]road that they walk on

Chorus:
Is [E]paved with gold
I[F#m]t's always summer
They'll [C#7]never get cold
They'll [D]never get hungry
They'll [A]never get old aand g[E]rey
You can see their [A]shadows wandering [E]off somewhere
They [F#m]won't make it home
But they [C#7]really don't care
They [D]wanted the highway
They[A]re happier there to[E]day
To[C#7]day
