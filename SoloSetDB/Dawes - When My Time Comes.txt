Intro:
[E][A][E][A][C#m][A]

[E][A][E][A][C#m][A]

Verse:
There were [E]moments of dreams, I was offered to s[A]ave.
I lived [E]less like a workhorse, more like a [A]slave.
I thought that [C#m]one quick moment that was noble or brave
would be [A]worth the most of my life.

So I [E]pointed my fingers, and shouted few quotes I [A]knew,
as if [E]something that's written, should be taken as [A]true.
But every [C#m]path I had taken and conclusion I drew
would put [A]truth back under the knife.

Bridge:
And now the [F#m]only piece of advice that continues to [B7]help
is anyone that's [C#m]making anything [B]new only breaks something [A]else.

Chorus:
[E]When [A]my time [E]comes,  [A]ooohh-[C#m]oohhh-[B]ooohh-[A]ooohhhh
[E]When [A]my time [E]comes,  [A]ooohh-[C#m]oohhh-[B]ooohh-[A]ooohhhh
Verse:
So I [E]took what I wanted, and put it out of my [A]reach.
I wanted to [E]pay for my successes, with all my de[A]feats.
And if [C#m]Heaven was all that was promised to me
why [A]don't I pray for a death?

Now it [E]seems like the unravelling started too [A]soon.
Now I'm [E]sleeping in hallways and I'm drinking per[A]fume,
and I'm [C#m]speaking to mirrors, and I'm howling at moons,
while the [A]worse and the worse that it gets.

Bridge:
Oh you can [F#m]judge the whole world on the sparkle that you think it [B7]lacks.
Yes, you can [C#m]stare into the a[B]byss, but it's starin' right [A]back.

Chorus:
[E]When [A]my time [E]comes,  [A]ooohh-[C#m]oohhh-[B]ooohh-[A]ooohhhh
[E]When [A]my time [E]comes,  [A]ooohh-[C#m]oohhh-[B]ooohh-[A]ooohhhh

Solo:
[E][A][E][A][C#m][A]

[E][A][E][A][C#m][A]

Bridge:
Well you can [F#m]judge the whole world on the sparkle that you think it [B7]lacks.
Yes, you can [C#m]stare into the a[B]byss, but it's starin' right [A]back.

Chorus:
[E]When [A]my time [E]comes,  [A]ooohh-[C#m]oohhh-[B]ooohh-[A]ooohhhh
[E]When [A]my time [E]comes,  [A]ooohh-[C#m]oohhh-[B]ooohh-[A]ooohhhh
[E]When [A]my time [E]comes,  [A]ooohh-[C#m]oohhh-[B]ooohh-[A]ooohhhh
