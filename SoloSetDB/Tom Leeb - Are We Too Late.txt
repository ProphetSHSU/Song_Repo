[Verse 1]
We never seen a day no never held a hand no
Found a way to feel the same
I’ve never flown for hours to make one city hour
And checked the weather where you were

[Chorus 1]
I may never leave you now
‘Cause I have finally seen you now 
I may never leave you now
‘Cause I’ve been waiting on your eyes to set in mine 
I go ahead and fly away
Drive away in my thoughts and get to you somehow 
I go ahead and fly again
‘Cause everything I see you already are to me (already are to me)
Oohoohooh, oohoohooh, oohoohooh, oohoohooh

[Verse 2]
The world is raging out there
The wars are going nowhere, still I’ll just want to heal you there 
It might seem innocent, out of nowhere
Somehow I check the weather again

[Chorus 2]
I may never leave you now, 
‘cause I have finally seen you now
I may never leave you now, 
‘cause I’ve been waiting on your eyes to set in mine

[Bridge]
I go ahead and fly away, drive away 
I travel in my thoughts and get to you somehow
I go ahead and fly again, 
‘cause everything I see you already are to me (already are to me)

[Outro]
I move from a corner 
to stand on the water
But my are we too late? 
Are we late? Are we too late?
Oohoohooh, oohoohooh, oohoohooh, oohoohooh
