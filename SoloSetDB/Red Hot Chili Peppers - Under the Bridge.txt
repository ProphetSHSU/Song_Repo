Verse:
   [Em]Come to decide that the [C]things that I tried
    Were [G]in my life just [D]to get high on.
[Em]    When I sit alone, [C]come, get a little known,
    [G]But I need more than my[D]self this time.
    [Em]Step from the road to the [C]sea to the sky,
    And I [G]do believe what [D]we rely on.
    [Em]When I lay it on,[C] come, get to play it on, [G]all my life to sa[D]crifice.

Chorus:
    [Em]Hey o[C]h,     [G]  listen [D]what I [Em]say, [C]oh.  [G][D]
    I got your, [Em]hey o[C]h,    [G]    now listen [D]what I [Em]say, [C]oh.  [G][D]

Verse:
   [Em]When  will know that [C]really can’t go
    To the [G]well one more time [D]to decide on.
[Em]    When it’s killing me, [C]when will really see,
    [G]All that I need to [D]look inside ?
    [Em]Come to believe that I [C]better not leave,
    Be[G]fore I get my [D]chance to ride.
[Em]    When it’s killing me, [C]what do I really need,
    [G]All that I need to [D]look inside ?

Chorus:
    [Em]Hey o[C]h,   [G]    listen [D]what I [Em]say, [C]oh.  [G][D]
    Come back and, [Em]hey [C]oh,   [G]      look at [D]what I [Em]say, [C]oh. [G][D]

Bridge:
The [C]more I see, the less I know,
The [Am]more I like to let it go, [Em]hey [C]oh, oh oh oh.

[G]Deep beneath the cover of an[D]other perfect wonder,
Where it’s [Am]so white as snow.
[G]Privately divided by a [D]world so undecided,
And there’s [Am]nowhere to go.
[G]In between the cover of an[D]other perfect wonder,
Where it’s [Am]so white as snow.
[G]Running through the field where all my [D]tracks will be concealed,
And there’s [Am]nowhere to go.

Verse:
   [Em]When to descend to [C]amend for a friend,
    All the [G]channels that have [D]broken down.
[Em]    Now you bring it up, [C]I’m gonna ring it up,
    [G]Just to hear you [D]sing it out.
    [Em]Step from the road to the [C]sea to the sky,

    And I [G]do believe what [D]we rely on.
[Em]    When I lay it on, [C]come, get to play it on, [G]all my life to sa[D]crifice.

Chorus:
    [Em]Hey o[C]h,   [G]    listen [D]what I [Em]say, [C]oh.  [G][D]

Where it’s [Am]so white as snow.
[G]Privately divided by a [D]world so undecided,

[G]In between the cover of [D]another perfect wonder,
Where it’s [Am]so white as snow.
[G]Running through the field where all my [D]tracks will be concealed,
And there’s [Am]nowhere to go.
