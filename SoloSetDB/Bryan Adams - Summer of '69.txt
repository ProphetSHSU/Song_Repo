Verse:
[D]I got my first real six string
[A]Bought it at the five and dime
[D]Played it 'til my fingers bled
[A]It was the summer of sixty nine
[D]Me and some guys from school
[A]Had a band and we tried real hard.
[D]Jimmy quit, Jody got married
[A]I should've known we'd never get far

Pre-Chorus:
[Bm]  Oh, when I [A]look back now
[D] That summer seemed to [G]last forever
[Bm]  And if I [A]had the choice
[D] Yeah, I'd always [G]wanna be there
[Bm]  Those were the [A]best days of my [D]life[A]

Verse:
[D]It ain't no use in complaining
[A]When you got a job to do
[D]Spent my evenings down at the drive in
[A]And that's when I met you, yeah

Pre-Chorus:
[Bm]  Standin' on your [A]mama's porch
[D] You told me that you'd [G]wait forever
[Bm]  And when you [A]held my hand
[D] I knew that it was [G]now or never
[Bm]  Those were the [A]best days of my [D]life

Chorus:
Oh, yeah.[A]
Back in the summer of [D]sixty nine.[A]

Bridge:
[F] Man we were [Bb]killing time
We were [C]young and restless
[Bb]Needed to unwind
[F] I guess [Bb]nothin' could last fore[C]ver, forever, no!
[D][A][D][A]

Verse:
[D]And now the times are changin'
[A]Look at everything that's come and gone
[D]Sometimes when I play that old six string
[A]I think about you, wonder what went wrong

Pre-Chorus:
[Bm]  Standin' on your [A]mama's porch
[D] You told me that it'd [G]last forever
[Bm]  Oh, and when you [A]held my hand
[D] I knew that it was [G]now or never
[Bm]  Those were the [A]best days of my [D]life

Chorus:
Oh, yeah.[A]
Back in the summer of [D]sixty nine, oh.[A]
It was the summer of [D]sixty nine, oh, yeah.[A]

Solo:
[D]Sixty nine
