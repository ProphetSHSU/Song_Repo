Intro:
[G]

Verse 1:
[G] When we were younger we thought
Everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little
And romanticized the [Cadd9]time I saw
Flowers in your hair
[G] Cause it takes a b[D]oy to live
Takes a m[Cadd9]an to pretend he was there[G]

Verse 2:
[G] So then we grew a little and knew a lot
And now we demonstrated it to the cops
And all the [Cadd9]things we said
We were selfassured
[G] Cause it's a l[D]ong road to wisdom
But it's a s[Cadd9]hort one
To being ignored
[G] Be in my eyes

Chorus:
[Em]   [D] Be in my heart
[G] Be in my eyes[Em]  ai yai yai
[D] Be in my heart[G]

Verse 3:
[G] So now I think that I could
Love you back
And I hope it's not too late 
cause you're so attractive
And the [Cadd9]way  you move
I won't close my eyes
[G] Cause it takes a m[D]an to live
But it takes a woman[Cadd9]     
to make him compromise
[G] Be in my eyes

Chorus:
[Em]   [D] Be in my heart
[G] [D/F#] Be in my eyes[Em]  ai yai yai
[D] Be in my heart[G]
