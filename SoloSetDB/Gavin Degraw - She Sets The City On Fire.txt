Intro:
[G]Everybody knows she's a perfect ten
And I'm h[C]anging on tight til the whole thing ends
Cause N[Em]ew York sky don't get much brighter
Sh[C]e sets, she sets the city on fire

Verse:
S[G]omebody told me if I'm not careful
Well, this [C]one's gonna roll me
I got my hands full and this [Em]one's gonna own me and control me
[C]I'm so mystified
She caught the l[G]ast train last night, left another note
Saying "s[C]ee you next time; miss me if you don't"
You l[Em]ook good in your bed; til we meet again
You went through my h[C]ead and nobody told me so

Pre-Chorus:
[G]Everybody knows she's a perfect ten
And I'm h[C]anging on tight til the whole thing ends
Cause N[Em]ew York sky don't get much brighter
Sh[C]e sets, she sets the city on fire

Chorus:
Sh[G]e sets the city on fire
[C]Burns like a million lighters
I'm going [Em]up, I couldn't get much higher
Sh[C]e sets, she sets the city on fire[G]

Verse:
N[G]ew scene, next block
She'll be jaywalking right [C]across while the cops talk
Make you feel like a b[Em]oss when your eyes lock
And you can't stop st[C]aring endlessly
She got the wh[G]ole thing figured out; hits me where it hurts
And I kn[C]ow I might be swinging at a curve
[Em]I don't mind it, though, when the lights are low
She can hit the n[C]otes wearing my T-shirt

Pre-Chorus:
[G]Everybody knows she's a perfect ten
And I'm h[C]anging on tight til the whole thing ends
Cause N[Em]ew York sky don't get much brighter
Sh[C]e sets, she sets the city on fire

Chorus:
Sh[G]e sets the city on fire
B[C]urns like a million lighters
I'm going [Em]up, I couldn't get much higher
Sh[C]e sets, she sets the city on fire
Bridge:
But [G]I don't know if I'm ch[C]asing ghosts
Put my h[Em]and in the flame of a flickering lighter
[C]Again and again, I was lucky just to find her
But [G]I don't know if I'm ch[C]asing ghosts
Put my h[Em]and in the flame of a flickering lighter
[C]Again and again, I was lucky

Pre-Chorus:
[G]Everybody knows she's a perfect ten
And I'm h[C]anging on tight til the whole thing ends
Cause N[Em]ew York sky don't get much brighter
Sh[C]e sets, she sets the city on fire

Chorus:
Sh[G]e sets the city on fire
B[C]urns like a million lighters
I'm going [Em]up, I couldn't get much higher
Sh[C]e sets, she sets the city on fire
I'm going [Em]up, I couldn't get much higher
Sh[C]e sets, she sets the city on fire[G]
