Intro:

[G6sus4][G7][C]

[Am][G6sus4][F]

[C][F][C]

Verse:
[C]With his back against [F]the San Francisco tra[C]ffic
[G6sus4]On the bridges side that [G7]faces towards the ja[C]il
[Am]Setting out t[G6sus4]o join a demographi[F]c,
[C]He hoists his firs[F]t leg up over the r[C]ail.

[C]A phone call's made, pol[F]ice cars show up qui[C]ckly.
[G6sus4]The sergeant sl[G7]ams his passenger do[C]or.
[Am]He says, Hey son why[G6sus4] don't you talk through this with [F]me,
[C]Just tell me what [F]you're doing it for.[C]

Chorus:
[Am]Oh, it's a little bit of e[C]verything,
[Am]It's the mountains, [Em]it's the fog,
[F]It's the news at six o'c[C]lock,
It's th[G6sus4]e death of my first [G7]dog.
[C]It's the angels up abov[F]e me,
[C]It's the song th[C/B]at they don't [Am]sing,
[G6sus4]It's a little bit of[G7] everything.[C]

Verse:
There's an [C]older man who s[F]tands in a buffet lin[C]e,
He is s[G6sus4]miling and he's h[G7]olding out his pl[C]ate,
And the f[Am]urther he looks b[G6sus4]ack into his timeli[F]ne,
That h[C]ard road always l[F]ed him to today.[C]

Making [C]up for when his br[F]ight future had left hi[C]m,
[G6sus4]Making up for the f[G7]act that his only son is [C]gone,
[Am]And letting everythin[G6sus4]g out once, his server as[F]ks him,
[C]Have you figured out [F]yet, what it is you w[C]ant?

Chorus:
[Am]I want a little bit of ev[C]erything,
[Am]The biscuits and the[Em]beans,
[F]Whatever helps me to f[C]orget about
The th[G6sus4]ings that brought me[G7]to my knees.
[C]So pile on those mashe[F]d potatoes,
[C]And an ext[C/B]ra chicken win[Am]g,
[G6sus4]I'm having a l[G7]ittle bit of e[C]verything.

Solo:
Verse:
[C]Somewhere a pret[F]ty girl is writing[C]invitations,
[G6sus4]To a wedding she ha[G7]s scheduled for the fall,[C]
[Am]Her man says, Baby[G6sus4], can I make an observati[F]on?
[C]You don't seem to be h[F]aving any fun at all.[C]

[C]She said, You just worry about your g[F]roomsmen and your s[C]hirt-size,
[G6sus4]And rest assured th[G7]at this is making me feel[C]good,
[Am]I think that love is so muc[G6sus4]h easier than you r[F]ealize,
[C]If you can give yours[F]elf to someone, then [C]you should.

Chorus:
[Am]Cause it's a little bit of[C]everything,
[Am]The way you joke, [Em]the way you ache,
[F]It is getting up before[C]you,
So I[G6sus4] could watch you as yo[G7]u wake.
[C]So on the day in late [F]September,
[C]It's not so[C/B]me stupid litt[Am]le ring,
[G6sus4]I'm getting a little [G7]bit of every[C]thing.

[Am]Oh, it's a little bit of e[C]verything,
[Am]It's the matador and [Em]the bull,
[F]It's the suggested dail[C]y dosage,
It'[G6sus4]s the red moon when [G7]it's full.
[C]All these psychics and[F]these doctors,
[C]They're all[C/B] right and the[Am]y're all wrong,
It's like t[C]rying to make out ev[F]ery word,
When they should s[C]imply hum al[Am]ong.
It's not some m[C]essage written in the da[F]rk,
Or some [C]truth that [C/B]no one's [Am]sees,
It[G6sus4]'s a little bit of [G7]everything.[C]
