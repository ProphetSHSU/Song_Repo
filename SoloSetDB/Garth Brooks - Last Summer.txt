Intro:
[D][E][D][A/C#][Bm]

Verse:
I went to work for her that[A] summer, 
a teenage kid so far from [F#m]home
She was a lonely widow [D]woman, 
hellbent to make it on her [E]own
We were a thousand miles from [A]nowhere, 
wheat fields as far as I could [F#m]see
Both needing something from each [D]other,
[E] not knowing yet what that might[A]be

Verse:
'Til she came to me one[A] ev'ning, 
hot cup of coffee and a [F#m]smile
In a dress that I was[D] certain, 
she hadn't worn in quite a [E]while
There was a diff'r'nce in her laugh[A]ter, 
there was a softness in her eyes[F#m]
And on the air there was a[D] hunger,
[E] even a boy could recog[A]nize

Chorus:
She had a need to feel the [E]thunder,
[D] to chase the lightning from the [A]sky
To watch a storm with all its [D]wonder, 
raging in her lover's [E]eyes
She had to ride the heat of [F#m]passion,
[E]  [D] like a comet burning[A]
Rushing head long in the wind,
[D] out where only dreams have [E]been.
Burning both ends of the [A]night[D/A][A]

Verse:
That summer wind was all a [A]round me, 
nothing between us but the night[F#m]
When I told her that I'd nev[D]er, 
she softly whispered "That's al[E]right"
And then I watched her hands[A] of leather, 
turn to velvet in a touch[F#m]
There's never been another [D]summer,
[E] when I have ever learned so [A]much

Chorus:
We had a need to feel the [E]thunder,
[D] to chase the lightning from the [A]sky
To watch a storm with all its [D]wonder, 
raging in her lover's [E]eyes
We had to ride the heat of [F#m]passion,
[E]  [D] like a comet burning[A]
Rushing head long in the wind,
[D] out where only dreams have [E]been.
Burning both ends of the [A]night

Verse:
[D]  [E]  [A] I often think about that[A] summer, 
the sweat, the moonlight and the lace[F#m]
And I have rarely held[D] another, 
when I haven't seen her [E]face
Ev'ry time I pass a wheat[A] field, 
and watch it dancing with the wind[F#m]
Although I know it isn't [D]real, 
I just can't help but [E]feel her hungry arms again[A]

Chorus:
She had a need to feel the [E]thunder,
[D] to chase the lightning from the [A]sky
To watch a storm with all its [D]wonder, 
raging in her lover's [E]eyes
She had to ride the heat of [F#m]passion,
[E]  [D] like a comet burning[A]
Rushing head long in the wind,[D] 
out where only dreams have [E]been.
Rushing head long in [A]the wind, 
out where only dreams [D]have been.
Burning both ends of the [E]night
