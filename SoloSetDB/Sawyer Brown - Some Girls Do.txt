Verse:
[A]She turned up her nose as she [G]walked by my Cadill[D]ac
From the [A]corner of my eye I saw [G]you and you [D]laughed
You were [A]sittin on the swing on your front porch
[G]Paintin your nails like you were bored
[A]And you yelled "She was [G]sure impressed with [D]you”

Chorus:
Well [G]I ain't first class
But [A]I ain't white trash
I'm [G]wild and a little [A]crazy too
[G]Some girls don't like [A]boys like me
[G]    [A]Awe, some girls [D]do

Verse:
I [A]yelled and asked if [G]you would like a [D]ride
When we [A]pulled out of your yard, [G]I bald a [D]tire
You was l[A]aughing at me, I was doing James Dean
You was the [G]prettiest girl I'd ever seen
When you [A]rolled your eyes and [G]twirled my pink fur [D]dice

Chorus:
Well [G]I ain't first class
But [A]I ain't white trash
I'm [G]wild and a little [A]crazy too
[G]Some girls don't like [A]boys like me
[G]    [A]Awe, some girls [D]do

Bridge:
[A][G][D]
[A][G][D]

Well [A]good ole boys don't get no breaks
And [G]rich boys think they got what it takes
But t[A]here's some one for [G]each of us they [D]say

Chorus:
Well [G]I ain't first class
But [A]I ain't white trash
I'm [G]wild and a little [A]crazy too
[G]Some girls don't like [A]boys like me
[G]    [A]Awe, some girls [D]do

Well [G]I ain't first class
But [A]I ain't white trash
I'm [G]wild and a little [A]crazy too
[G]Some girls don't like [A]boys like me
[G]    [A]Awe, some girls [D]do

[A]I said some girls [D]do.
[A]Ya know some girls [D]do,
Like [A]boys like [D]me.
[A]Ya know some girls [D]do
