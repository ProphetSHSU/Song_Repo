Verse:
[G]   I [D]heard you crying [Em]loud[C]
[G]  all the w[D]ay across [Em]town[C]
You've been s[G]earching for that s[D]omeone
and it's [Em]me out on the pr[C]owl
As y[G]ou sit around[D] feeling s[Em]orry for your[C]self

[G]  Well, [D]don't get lonely [Em]now[C]
[G]  And [D]dry your whining [Em]eyes[C]
I'm just [G]roaming for the [D]moment
Sleazin' [Em]my back yard so don't g[C]et
[G]so uptight you b[D]een thinking about d[Em]itching me[C]

[G]  So d[D]on't knock down my d[Em]oor[C]
I'm a l[G]oser and a u[D]ser so I d[Em]on't need no a[C]ccuser
to t[G]ry and slag me d[D]own because I k[Em]now you're r[C]ight
[G]  So [D]go do what you [Em]like[C]
[G]  Make s[D]ure you do it [Em]wise[C]
You may f[G]ind out that your s[D]elf doubt
means no[Em]thing was ever [C]there
You c[G]an't go forcing s[D]omething
if it's j[Em]ust not r[C]ight
