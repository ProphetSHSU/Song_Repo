Intro:
[D][D]
[D][A][Bm]
[G]
[Em] [A]

Verse:
You [D]always had an eye for things that glitter
but [Bm]I was far from being made of gold
I [G]don't know how but I scraped up the money
[Em]I just never could quite tell you [A]no
Just [D]like when you were leaving Amarillo
[Bm]Takin' that new job in Tennessee
and [G]I quit mine so we could be together
I [Em]can't forget the way you looked at [A]me

Chorus:
[D]Just to [A]see you [Bm]smile
I'd do anyt[G]hing that you [Em]wanted me [A]to
when [D]all is [A]said and [Bm]done
I'd never count the [G]cost
It's worth all that's [E]lost[G]
[A]Just to see you [D]smile

Post-Chorus:
[D][A][Em][A]

Verse:
When [D]you said time was all you really needed
I [Bm]walked away and let you have your space
Cause [G]leaving didn't hurt me near as badly
as the [Em]tears I saw rolling down your [A]face
and [D]yesterday I knew just what you wanted
when [Bm]you came walking up to me with him
so [G]I told you that I was happy for you
and [Em]given the chance I'd lie aga[A]in

Chorus:
[D]Just to [A]see you [Bm]smile
I'd do anyt[G]hing that you [Em]wanted me [A]to
when [D]all is [A]said and [Bm]done
I'd never count the [G]cost
It's worth all that's [E]  lost[G]
[A]Just to see you [D]smile

[D]Just to [A]see you [Bm]smile
I'd do anyt[G]hing that you [Em]wanted me [A]to
when [D]all is [A]said and [Bm]done
I'd never count the [G]cost
It's worth all that's [E] lost[G]
[A]Just to see you [D]smile
