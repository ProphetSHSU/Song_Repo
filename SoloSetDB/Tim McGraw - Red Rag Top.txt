Intro:
[G] [C]

Verse:
[G]I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were ju[C]st about as wild as we were green in the [G]ways of the world[C]
Well she p[G]icked me up in that red ragtop
we were f[C]ree of the folks and hiding from the cops
on a summ[G]er night, runnin' all the[Cadd9]red lights
so we'd p[G]ark way out in a clearing in a grove
and the ni[C]ght was as hot as a coal burnin' stove
we were co[G]okin' with gas,
oh it ha[Cadd9]d to last

Chorus:
in the back of that [C]red [G]rag [Am]top
she said [C]please do[G]n't st[Am]op

Verse:
well the v[G]ery first time her mother met me
her [C]green eyed girl had been a mother to be for t[G]wo weeks [C]

I was o[G]ut of a job and she was in school
[C]life was fast and the world was cruel
we were [G]young and wild,
we decided not to [C]have a child
so we [G]did what we did and we tried to forget
and we [C]swore up and down there would be no regrets in the [G]morning light
but on the way[Cadd9]home that night

Chorus 2:
on the back of that [C]red [G]rag t[Am]op
she said plea[C]se [G]dont [Am]stop loving [G]me [Cadd9]

Bridge:
we took [C]one more [G]trip ar[Am]ound the s[G]un
and it was [C]all make beli[G]eve in the [Am]end
no I c[C]an't say wh[G]ere she [Am]is toda[G]y
I can't rem[Am]ember who I w[G]as back t[Am]hen

Instrumental:
[G][C]

Verse:
well you [G]do what you do
and you pay for your sins and there's [C]no such thing as what might have been
that's a wa[G]ste of time,
drive you o[C]ut of your mind
I was sto[G]pped at a red light just yesterday bes[C]ide a young girl in a cabriolet
and her [G]eyes were green
and I was in an [Cadd9]old scene

Chorus:
I was back in that[C] red [G]rag [Am]top
on the [C]day s[G]he s[Am]topped lovin [G]me [Cadd9]
I was back in that [C]red [G]rag t[Am]op
on the [C]day s[G]he [Am]stopped lovin [G]me
