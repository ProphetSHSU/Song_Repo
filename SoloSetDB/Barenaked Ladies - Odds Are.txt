[Cadd9][G][Em7][D]

Verse:
(D)       Cadd9
Struck by lightning,
Sounds pretty frighte[G]ning,
But you know the chan[Em7]ces are so s[D]mall.
Stuck by a [Cadd9]bee sting,
Nothing but a bee [G]thing,
Better chance you're gonna [Em7]buy it at the m[D]all.
But it's a [Cadd9]twenty-three or four-to-one,
That [G]you can fall in love [Em7]by the end of this [D]song.
So [Cadd9]get up, get up,
Tell the bookie [G]"put a bet on",
Not a damn [Em7]thing will go [D]wrong.

Chorus:
The [Cadd9]odds are that [G]we will proba[Em7]bly be,
[D]Alright,
[Cadd9]Odds are we gonna be [G]alright,
Odds [Em7]are we gonna be al[D]right tonight,
The [Cadd9]odds are that [G]we will proba[Em7]bly be,
[D]Alright,
[Cadd9]Odds are we gonna be [G]alright,
Odds [Em7]are we gonna be a[D]lright for another night.[(Cadd9)]

Verse:
Hit by the A-train,
Crashed in an airplane,
I wouldn't recommend either one,
Killed by a great white,
Or a meteorite,
I guess there ain't no way to go that's fun,
But somewhere in the world,
Someone is gonna fall in love by the end of this song.
So get up, get up,
No, it's never gonna let up,
So you might as well sing along.

Chorus:
The [Cadd9]odds are that [G]we will proba[Em7]bly be,
[D]Alright,
[Cadd9]Odds are we gonna be [G]alright,
Odds [Em7]are we gonna be al[D]right tonight,
The [Cadd9]odds are that [G]we will proba[Em7]bly be,
[D]Alright,
[Cadd9]Odds are we gonna be [G]alright,
Odds [Em7]are we gonna be a[D]lright for another night.[(Cadd9)]

Bridge:
[Cadd9] Sure th[G]ings go wr[Em7]ong,
But [D]I'll take my ch[Cadd9]ances,
O[G]dds are [Em7]long,
So [D]why not [Cadd9,]plaaaaa[G,]aaa[Em7,]aaaay[D]?

Instrumental:
[Cadd9][G][Em7][D]

Verse:
Struck by lightning,
Sounds pretty frightening,
But you know the chances are so small,
Hit by the A-train,
Crashed in an airplane,
Better chance you're gonna buy it at the mall,
But it's a twenty-three or four-to-one,
That you can fall in love by the end of this song,
So get up, get up,
No, I'm never gonna let up,
So you might as well sing along.

Chorus:
The [Cadd9]odds are that [G]we will proba[Em7]bly be,
[D]Alright,

The [Cadd9]odds are that [G]we will proba[Em7]bly be,
[D]Alright,
[Cadd9]Odds are we gonna be [G]alright,
Odds [Em7]are we gonna be a[D]lright for another night.[(Cadd9)]

The [Cadd9]odds are that [G]we will proba[Em7]bly be,
[D]Alright,
[Cadd9]Odds are we gonna be [G]alright,
Odds [Em7]are we gonna be al[D]right tonight,
The [Cadd9]odds are that [G]we will proba[Em7]bly be,
[D]Alright,
[Cadd9]Odds are we gonna be [G]alright,
Odds [Em7]are we gonna be a[D]lright for another night.[(Cadd9)]
