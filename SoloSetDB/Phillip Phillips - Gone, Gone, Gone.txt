Intro:
[G]

Verse:
 When l[G]ife leaves you high and dry
 I'll be at your door tonight 
 If[Dsus4]you need help, if you need help
 I'll [Em7]shut down the city lights

 I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe 
 To[Cadd9]make you well, to make you well

 When [G]enemies are at your door
 I'll carry you way from more
 If[Dsus4]you need help, if you need help
 Your [Em7]hope dangling by a string

 I'll share in your suffering 
 To [Cadd9]make you well, to make you well

 Give me[Cadd9] reasons [G]to beli[D]eve
 That you woul[Cadd9]d do the s[G]ame for m[D]e

 And I would do it for [Cadd9]yooooouu[G]uu, for y[Em7]ooooouuu[D]uuu

 I love you [Em7]long after you're g[D]one
 For y[Cadd9]ooooouuu[G]uu, for yo[Em7]ooooouu[D]uuu
 You would[Cadd9] never sleep al[G]one
 I love you [Em7]long after you're g[D]one

 And long after you're gone gone gone

Verse:
 When you f[G]all like a statue

 I'm gon' be there to catch you
 Put you[Dsus4]on your feet, you on your feet
 And if [Em7]your heart is empty

 Not a thing will prevent me
 Tell me[Cadd9]what you need, what do you need

 And long after you're gone gone gone

 You're my back b[G]one, you're me corner[Cadd9]stone
 You're my crutch when my legs stop moving[Em7]
 You're my headst[G]art, you're my rugged [Cadd9]heart

 You're the pokes that I've always needed
