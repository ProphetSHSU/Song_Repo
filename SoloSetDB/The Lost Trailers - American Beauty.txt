Intro:
Verse 1:
Blush showing on your face
Smell of the hair spray
Springsteen on the radio waves

Verse 2:
Lights dancing in a field 
spinning Ferris wheel
Get three throw for one-dollar bill

Verse 3:
Straw in a coke and you take a sip
Funnel cake burning up your fingertips
Kiss the powdered sugar off of your sweet lips.

Chorus 1:
Feel so good so right

Fall in love tonight

Verse 4:
We could watch the marching band
But we got other plans
Stamp on both our hands
In case we want to go back

Verse 5:
Road in the dark 
find a place to park
We can watch the fireworks start

Verse 6:
Laying on a blanket and I pull you to me
Just like a scene from a drive in movie
Don't have anywhere to go now do we

Chorus 2:
Feel so good so right
American beauty

Fall in love tonight
American beauty
American beauty

Ooo oo oo oo oo oo oo oo

Bridge:
Colored up like a Rockwell painting
Dancing round in my blue suede shoe
Apple pie that momma's baking
Look around I love the view...yes I do

Feel so good so right

Fall in love tonight
