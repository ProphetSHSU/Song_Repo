[C][G/B][F][C/E][G][Am][F]

Verse:
I was [C]dancing with some kids[G/B]
In this [F]house where I lived
A couple [G]lifetimes, [Am]maybe [F]more
We had the [C]music up loud[G/B]
By that [F]old leather couch
Where [C/E]I lost my [G]best friend a couple [Am]years be[F]fore
And on the [C]front porch steps[G/B]
I smoked a [F]million cigarettes
With every [G]woman I [Am]loved and [F]left
The loudest [C]house on the block[G/B]
The neighbors [F]never called the cops
But [C/E]I don't wanna [G]test ’em [Am]any[F]more

Interlude:
[C] [G/B][F][C/E][G][Am][F]

Verse:
I was [C]down on the beach[G/B]
[F]Just out of reach[C/E]
Of a [G]freaked out kid l[Am]earning to [F]swim
He was [C]doing his best[G/B]
He was [F]holding his breath
[C/E]As the [G]water [Am]rose past [F]his chest[C/E][F]

Chorus:
Sometimes I [C]feel like I'm caught in a r[G]iptide
That's pulling me [Am]out to a w[G]atery g[F]rave
Sometimes I [C]feel like I’ve seen e[G]nough
It's all too [Am]much, I feel like [G]giving [F]up on better days

Interlude:
[C] [G/B][F][C/E][G][Am][F]

Verse:
There was this [C]guy that I knew[G/B]
We met when [F]I was 22
In [C/E]San [G]Diego when [Am]I was [F]on tour
He was a [C]real good dude
[G/B]Every[F]one was drawn to
[C/E]Like the [G]ocean [Am]to the moon[F]
I got the [C]news that he died[G/B]
That he [F]took his own life[C/E]
And left a [G]beautiful wife and [Am]baby boy[F]
I may [C]never understand[G/B]
The full [F]measure of a man
But [C/E]this is what [G]I'd tell him if [Am]he was here[F]

Chorus 2:
Sometimes it [C]feels like you're caught in a[G]riptide
That's pulling you [Am]out to a w[G]atery g[F]rave
Sometimes it [C]feels like you’ve seen e[G]nough
It's all too [Am]much, you feel like [G]giving [F]up

Chorus 3:
Sometimes it [C]feels like I'm stretched too [G]thin
How does anyone [Am]win in this [G]race that we’re [F]in?
Sometimes the g[C]oing gets pretty [G]rough
But I’m hangin' [Am]tough, I’m not [G]giving [F]up on better [C]days[G][Am][G][F]
I'm not giving [C]up[G][Am][G][F]
