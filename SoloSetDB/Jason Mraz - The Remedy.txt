Intro:
[Em][C][G][D][G/B][C][G][D]
[Em][C][G][D][G/B][C][G][D]

Verse:
I saw fir[Em]eworks from the fr[A]eeway and beh[D]ind closed eyes I cannot [G]make them go away
Cause you were b[Em]orn on the fourth of jul[A]y, freedom ring now s[D]omething on the surface it s[G]tings
[Em]Something on the surface, well, [A]it kind of makes me nervous
Who s[D]ays that you deserve this and w[G]hat kind of god would serve this?
We will c[Em]ure this dirty o[A]ld disease, well, if [D]you'[*stop*]ve gots the poison I've gots the remedy

Pre-Chorus:
The r[Em]emedy is the expe[A]rience; this is a d[D]angerous l[G]iaison
I says the [Em]comedy is that its s[A]erious. This is a st[D]range enough new [G]play on words
I say the t[Em]ragedy is how you're gon[A]na spend the r[D]est of your nights with the [G]light on
So shine the l[Em]ight on all of[A] your friends because it [D]all[*stop*]amounts to nothing in the end.

Chorus:
[G]I--[C]---[D]----I wont [D]worry my li[Em]fe a[G/B]way, h[C]ey, [D]oh
[G]I--[C]---[D]----I wont [D]worry my li[Em]fe a[G/B]way, h[C]ey, [D]oh

Interlude:

[Em][C][G][D][G/B][C][G][D]

Verse:
I heard [Em]two men talking on the r[A]adio in a c[D]ross fire kind of new [G]reality show
Unco[Em]vering the ways to plan the [A]next big attack
Well, they were co[D]unting down the days to stab the [G]brother in the...
Be right b[Em]ack after this the unavoi[A]dable kiss,
Where the [D]minty fresh death breath is su[G]re to outlast this...
Ca[Em]tastrophe - da[A]nce with me, 'cause if[D] yo[*stop*]u've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

Pre-Chorus:
The r[Em]emedy is the expe[A]rience; this is a d[D]angerous l[G]iaison
I says the [Em]comedy is that its s[A]erious. This is a st[D]range enough new [G]play on words
I say the t[Em]ragedy is how you're gon[A]na spend the r[D]est of your nights with the [G]light on
So shine the l[Em]ight on all of[A] your friends because it [D]all[*stop*]amounts to nothing in the end.
Chorus:
[G]I--[C]---[D]----I wont [D]worry my li[Em]fe aw[Bm]ay, h[C]ey, [D]oh
[G]I--[C]---[D]----I wont [D]worry my li[Em]fe aw[Bm]ay, h[C]ey, [D]oh

Bridge:
[Em]  When I fall in[C]love, I take my time
[G]  There's no need to hur[D]ry when I'm making up my mind
[Em]  You can turn off the sun,[C]but I'm still gonna shine
[G]  And I'll tell you [D]why...
Because the r[G]emedy is the [C/G]experience. It is a [F/G]dangerous liai[Bb]son
I say the com[G]edy is that its se[C/G]rious. Which is a s[F/G]trange enough new [Bb]play on words
I say the tra[G]gedy is how you're gonn[C/G]a spend the re[F/G]st of your nights with the [Bb]light on
So shine the [G]light on all of your fr[C/G]iends because it [F]all [*stop*]amounts to nothing in the end.

Chorus/Outro:
[G]I--[C]---[D]----I wont [D]worry my li[Em]fe aw[Bm]ay, h[C]ey, [D]oh
[G]I--[C]---[D]----I wont [D]worry my li[Em]fe aw[Bm]ay, h[C]ey, [D]oh
[G]I--[C]---[D]----I wont [D]worry my li[Em]fe aw[Bm]ay, h[C]ey, [D]oh
[G]I--[C]---[D]----I wont [D]worry my li[Em]fe aw[Bm]ay, h[C]ey, [D]oh
