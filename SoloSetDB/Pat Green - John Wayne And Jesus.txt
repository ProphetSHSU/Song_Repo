Verse:
I met Jo[G]hn Wayne and Jesus when [C]I was just a kid
They b[G]oth had on their cowboy hats just l[C]ike I pictured them
I s[G]tood up at the front of the class wa[C]ving my American Flag
saying the p[G]ledge sang a[D]mber waves of gra[G]in.

Chorus:
I si[C]ng all the so[D]ngs of Am[G]erica
[C]Danced in the r[D]ain in Lafaye[G]tte
I'm st[C]ill hanging o[D]ut with J[G]ohn Wayne and J[Em]esus
and I kn[C]ow that is as go[D]od as life can g[G]et

Verse:
I h[G]ad a big time when I was down in H[C]ouston
I f[G]ell in love and I moved to New Orl[C]eans
We[G]ll, she said "so long" and I[C]'m here all alone
Sh[G]e's still got a little bi[D]tty piece of [C]me

Chorus:
I si[C]ng all the so[D]ngs of Am[G]erica
[C]Danced in the r[D]ain in Lafaye[G]tte
I'm st[C]ill hanging o[D]ut with J[G]ohn Wayne and J[Em]esus
and I kn[C]ow that is as go[D]od as life can g[G]et

Verse:
Well Jo[G]hn Wayne and Jesus moved to H[C]ollywood
W[G]orkin' behind the scenes on MT[C]V
[G]Me I'm still right down here in T[C]exas
[G]I know that's where I was a[D]lways meant to [C]be

Chorus:
I si[C]ng all the so[D]ngs of Am[G]erica
[C]Danced in the r[D]ain in Lafaye[G]tte
I'm st[C]ill hanging o[D]ut with J[G]ohn Wayne and J[Em]esus
and I kn[C]ow that is as go[D]od as life can g[G]et
