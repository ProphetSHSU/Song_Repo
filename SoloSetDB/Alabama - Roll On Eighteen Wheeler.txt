Chorus 1:
[E]Roll On highway, Roll On a[A]long.
[E]Roll On daddy till you get back [A]home.
[E]Roll On family, Roll On [A]crew.
[E]Roll On mama like I asked you to do.
And [F#m]Roll On Eighteen [B]Wheeler, Roll On.[E]

[E A E A]

Verse:
[A]Well it's Monday mornin', he's kissin' mama goodbye.
He's up and gone with the [C#m]sun.
[A]Daddy drives an eighteen wheeler,
and he's off on a midwest run.[E]

[A]And three sad faces gather 'round mama.
They ask her when daddy's comin' [C#m]home.
[A]Daddy drives an eighteen wheeler,
and they sure miss him when he's [E]gone.

Climb 1:
Ah, but he [A]calls 'em ev'ry [G#m]night and [F#7]tells 'em
that he loves [B]them.

He taught 'em this song to sing:

Chorus 1:
[E]Roll On highway, Roll On a[A]long.
[E]Roll On daddy till you get back [A]home.
[E]Roll On family, Roll On [A]crew.
[E]Roll On mama like I asked you to do.
And [F#m]Roll On Eighteen [B]Wheeler, Roll On.[E]

Verse:
[Bb]Well it's [F]Wednesday evening.

Mama's waitin' by the phone.
It rings but it's not his [Dm]voice.
Seems the high[Bb]way patrol has found a jack-knifed rig
in a snowbank in Illinois.[F]

But the driver was missin',

and the search had been abandoned
'cause the weather had ev'rything [Dm]stalled.
And they had [Bb]checked all the houses and the local motels;
when they had some more news they'd call.[F]

Climb 2:
And she told [Bb]them when they [Am]found him to tell [Gm7]him
that she loved [C]him.

And she hung up the phone singin':

Chorus 2:
[F]Roll On highway, Roll On along[Bb].
[F]Roll On daddy till you get back [Bb]home.
[F]Roll On family, Roll On [Bb]crew.
[F]Roll On mama like I asked you to do.
And [Gm]Roll On Eighteen [C]Wheeler, Roll On.[Dm]

Bridge:
[Dm]Mama and the children will be [Am7]waiting up all night long,
thinkin' [Bb]nothin' but the worst is comin'
with the ring[F]in' of the telephone.
Oh, but the [Dm]Man upstairs was list'nin'
when Mama [Bb]asked him to bring Daddy home.
And when the [Gm]call came in, it was Daddy on the other end,
[C]askin' her if she had been a-singin' the song, singin':

{comment: REPEAT Chorus 2, but instead of Dm at the end of "Roll On Eighteen Wheeler, Roll On", make it an F.}

[F][Bb]

[F]  Eighteen whee[Bb]ler
[F]  Eighteen whee[Bb]ler
[F]  Eighteen whee[Bb]ler
[F]  Eighteen whee[Bb]ler---- (hold until final "roll on!")
[Bb]   Ro[|Fm/Bb]ll On!
