Intro:
[E] [F#m][E][F#m]

Verse:
[E]Who's to say
What's impossible
Well [F#m]they forgot
This world keeps spinning
And with [E]each new day
I can feel a change in e[F#m]verything
And as the surface breaks ref[E]lections fade
But in some ways they remain [F#m]the same
And as my mind begins to [E]spread it's wings
There's no stopping curi[F#m]osity
I want to turn the whole thing [E]upside[F#m]down

Chorus:
[A] I'll find the [B]things they say just [E]can't be[F#m]found
[A] I'll share this [B]love I find with [E]every[F#m]one
[A] We'll sing and [B]dance to Mother [E]Nature's[F#m]songs
[A] I don't want[B] this feeling to go a[E]way

Bridge:
[F#m] [E][F#m]

Verse:
[E]Who's to say
I can't do everything
Well [F#m]I  can try
And as I roll along I be[E]gin to find
Things aren't always just [F#m]what they seem
I want to turn the whole thing [E]upside[F#m]down

Chorus:
[A] I'll find the [B]things they say just [E]can't be[F#m]found
[A] I'll share this [B]love I find with [E]every[F#m]one
[A] We'll sing and [B]dance to Mother [E]Nature's[F#m]songs
[A] This world keeps[B] spinning and there's [G#m]no time to [F#m]waste

Pre-Chorus:
Well it [G#m]all keeps [A]spinning spinning[B]round and round and

Chorus:
[E]Upside[F#m]down
[A] Who's to say [B]what's impossible and [E]can't be[F#m]found
[A] I don't want[B]this feeling to go away

Outro:
[E]  [F#m]   Please don't go away[E]
[F#m]   Please don't go away[E]
[F#m]   Please don't go away[E]
[F#m]   Is [A]this how it's[F#m]   supposed to [E]be
Is this how it's supposed to [F#m]be [A][E]
