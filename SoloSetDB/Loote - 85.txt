Verse:
[Em]Put your cigarette out, k[C]now I hate those
I hate [G]how you left a bad taste[Bm]in my mouth
[Em]I believed what I wanted[C]to see in you
[G]And it's true, now the truth's coming [Bm]out

Pre-Chorus:
There's a g[Em7]host in my bed[C]
Should've k[G]nown what to expe[Bm]ct
But you, [Em]you could tell me I'm differen[C]t

If it ends the same, what's the difference?
[G]Lie to me, make it seem better than[B]it ever was

Chorus:
[Em]Oh-oh, I should really[C]use my head
I should reall[G]y use my head 'stead of thin[Bm]king with my chest, yeah
[Em]Oh-oh, I was dyin[C]g to connect
Gave me [G]85%, only 85%[Bm], yeah

Post-Chorus:
N.C
Woah-oh, yeah, yeah

Verse:
We dive into things hea[C]d first
Hoping f[G]or something more than we kne[Bm]w we could be
[Em]You didn't have any cr[C]uel intentions
I[G] thought I mentioned I [Bm]want more than you

Pre-Chorus:
There's a [Em]ghost in my bed[C]
Guess it's nobo[G]dy's fault in the en[Bm]d
[Em]You lied to me, yo[C]u could tell me I'm different

If it ends the same, what's the difference?
[G]Lie to me, make it seem better t[B]han it ever was

Chorus:
[Em]Oh-oh, I should real[C]ly use my head
I should rea[G]lly use my head 'stead of thin[Bm]king with my chest, yeah
[Em]Oh-oh, I was dyi[C]ng to connect
Gave me 8[G]5%, only 85[Bm]%, yeah

Post-Chorus:
There's a gho[Em]st in my bed[C]
Should've k[G]nown what to expec[Bm]t
[Em]Oh-oh, I was dy[C]ing to connect
Gave me 85[G]%, only 85[Bm]%, yeah
Verse:
[Em]It's a challenge
Tryna find the balance between lo[A]ve and lust
All we got was lost when I re[D]ally thought we had it
F[Em]eelings fade and people change and things,[C]they fall apart
But that does[G]n't mean I don't believe in spe[Bm]aking from the heart
You see, you're mor[Em]e like Coke, I'm more like Pepsi
[C]I just hope you don't forget me
[G]It wasn't right, the way you left me
[Bm]Heartbreak Hotel always depressed me
[Em]Could you give me just a little bit more?
S[C]hould've known what I was asking for
[G]We met as friends, we'll end as friends
[Bm]We will be 'til we die, right?
But if you start to miss me, I don't like to be a[C]lone
So if you wanna t[G]ry again, you better let [Bm]me know

Chorus:
[Em]Oh-oh, I should real[C]ly use my head
I should rea[G]lly use my head 'stead of thin[Bm]king with my chest, yeah
[Em]Oh-oh, I was dyi[C]ng to connect
Gave me 8[G]5%, only 85[Bm]%, yeah
