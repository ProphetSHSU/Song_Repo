Verse:
[C]sometimes I feel
like I am d[Em]runk behind the wheel
the w[F]heel of possi[C]bility
[D7]How ever it may [G7]roll
[C]give it a spin
see if you can [Em]somehow factor in
[F]you know there's always m[C]ore than one way
[D7]to say exactly w[G7]hat you mean to s[C]ay

Chorus:
was I out of my h[G]ead
was I out of my [Am]mind
how could I have e[C]ver [C7]been so bl[F]ind?
I was waiting for an indic[C]ation
[D7]it was hard to f[G7]ind[C]
don't matter what I s[G]ay
only what I [Am]do
I never mean to [C]do bad [C7]things to y[F]ou
so quiet but I f[C]inally woke up
[D7]if you're sad then it's [G7]time you spoke up t[F]oo

[C][Em][F][C][D7][G7]
