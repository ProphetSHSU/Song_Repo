Verse:
 I br[G]oke free on a Saturday [D]morning
 I put the [C]pedal to the [G]floor
 Head[G]ed north on Mills A[D]venue
 And listened [C]to the engine [G]roar

[G][Bm][Cadd9][G]
[G][D][C][G]

 My [G]broken house behind me and [D]good things ahead
 A girl named [C]Cathy wants a little of my [G]time
 Six [G]cylinders underneath the [D]hood crashing and kicking
 [C]Ahah, listen to the engine[G]whine

Chorus:
 I am going to [G]make it through this [D]year
 If it [C]kills me[G]
 I am going to [G]make it through this [D]year
 If it [C]kills me[G]

[G][Bm][Cadd9][G]
[G][D][C][G]

Verse:
 I played [G]video games in a [D]drunken haze
 I was [C]17 years [G]young
 Hurt my [G]knuckles punching the ma[D]chines
 The taste of [C]scotch rich on my [G]tongue

[G][Bm][Cadd9][G]
[G][D][C][G]

 And then [G]Cathy showed up and we [D]hung out
 Trading [C]swigs from a bottle, all [G]bitter and clean
 Locking [G]eyes, holding [D]hands
 Twin high [C]maintenance ma[G]chines

Chorus:
 I am going to [G]make it through this [D]year
 If it [C]kills me[G]
 I am going to [G]make it through this [D]year
 If it [C]kills me[G]

Bridge:
[Em] I drove home in the California [G]dusk
[Em] I could feel the alcohol in[G]side of me hum
 Pictured the [Em]look on my stepfather's [G]face
 [C]Ready for the bad things to [D]come

Verse:
 I down-[G]shifted as I pulled into the [D]driveway
 The [C]motor screaming out, stuck in [G]second gear
 The scene ends [G]badly, as you might im[D]agine
 In a [C]cavalcade of anger and [G]fear
 There will be [G]feasting and [D]dancing in [C]Jerusalem next [D]year

Chorus:
 I am going to [G]make it through this [D]year
 If it [C]kills me[G]
 I am going to [G]make it through this [D]year
 If it [C]kills me[G]

[G][Bm][Cadd9][G]
[G][D][C][G]
