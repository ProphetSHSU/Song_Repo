Verse:
You'll always be my number [D]one
A whole lot more than good e[Em]nough
I'm giving everything I've [Bm]got
To gain every second [Gm/Bb]lost
Six years just ain't e[D]nough
With you, I'm happy being [D]me
Don't pretend, 'cause I don't [Em]need to
I'm a thousand miles from [Bm]home
Never on my [Gm/Bb]own
When you whisper down the [D]phone

Pre-Chorus:
Well, I [Bm]guess we never [A]saw this coming
[G]Halfway around the world calling
[Bm] But I just want [F#m]you to know[G][N.C.]

Chorus:
That [D]I'd have [F#m]all I [Bm7]need
If you were [G]standing right in front of me
[D] I'll [F#m]finally [Bm7]see what it [G]means to be complete
Don't [D]need to spend our lives chasing [F#m]gold
Any[Bm7]where with you, I'll call my [G]home
Oh, [D]I'd have [F#m]all I [Bm7]need
If you'd [G]be the [N.C.]better half of me

Verse:
I'm still up, it's 4 A[D]M
Is this Amsterdam or [Em]Berlin?
I'm just waiting for the [Bm]day
I finally get to [Gm/Bb]say
These words face to [D]face

Pre-Chorus:
Well, I [Bm]guess we never [A]saw this coming
[G]Halfway around the world calling
[Bm] But I just want [F#m]you to know[G][N.C.]

Chorus:
That [D]I'd have [F#m]all I [Bm7]need
If you were [G]standing right in front of me
[D] I'll [F#m]finally [Bm7]see what it [G]means to be complete
Don't [D]need to spend our lives chasing [F#m]gold
Any[Bm7]where with you, I'll call my [G]home
Oh, [D]I'd have [F#m]all I [Bm7]need
If you'd [G]be the better half of me

Chorus:
[D]I'd have [F#m]all I [Bm7]need
If you were [G]standing right in front of me
[D] I'll [F#m]finally [Bm7]see what it [G]means to be complete
Don't [D]need to spend our lives chasing [F#m]gold
Any[Bm7]where with you, I'll call my [G]home
Oh, [D]I'd have [F#m]all I [Bm7]need
If you'd [G]be the better half of [D]me

Outro:
If you'd [F#m]be the better half of [Bm7]me
Yeah, will you [G]be the better half of [D/F#]me?
Will you [G]be the better half of [D]me?
