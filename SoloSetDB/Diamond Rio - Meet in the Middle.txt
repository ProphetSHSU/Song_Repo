Intro:
[D][G][D][G]

Verse:
It was [D]seven hundred fence posts from your place to ours
[A]Neither one of us was old [G]enough to drive a car
[D]Sometimes it was rainin', sometimes it would shine
[A]We wore out that gravel road [G]between your house and mine

Chorus:
[D]I'd start walkin' your way, [G]you'd start walkin' [D]mine
[D]We meet in the middle 'neath that [A]old Georgia pine
We'd [D]gain a lot of ground, cause we'd [G]both give a [D]little
[D]Ain't no road too long when we [A]meet in the [G]middle[D][G]

Verse:
[D]It's been seven years tomorrow since we said our vows
[A]Under that old pine tree you [G]ought to see it now
[D]Standing in the backyard, reminding me and you
[A]If we don't see eye to eye there's [G]something we can do

Chorus:
[D]I'd start walkin' your way, [G]you'd start walkin' [D]mine
[D]We meet in the middle 'neath that [A]old Georgia pine
We'd [D]gain a lot of ground, cause we'd [G]both give a [D]little
[D]Ain't no road too long when we [A]meet in the [G]middle[D][G]

[G]Babe I love the way we [A]work it out

That's what love is all about
