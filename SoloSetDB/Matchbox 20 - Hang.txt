[G][Cadd9]

Verse:
[G]She grabs her magazines, she packs her things and she goe[Cadd9]s.
[Em]She leaves the pictures hangin' on the [D]wall.  
[G]She burns all her note[Cadd9]s
And she know[G]s, she's been here too few [D]years, to feel this old.[Cadd9]

[G]He smokes his cigarette, he stays outside 'til it's gone[Cadd9].
[Em]If anybody ever had a [D]heart, well[G], he wouldn't be alo[Cadd9]ne.
He knows,[G] she's been here too few y[D]ears, to be go[Cadd9]ne.
[D]And we [G]al[D]ways[Cadd9] say, it would b[G]e [D]go[Cadd9]od to go away, someday,
But if there's [Em]nothin' there to m[D]ake things change,
if it's the [Cadd9]same for you I'll just hang.[Cadd9]

Solo Fill:
[G][Cadd9]

Verse:
[G]The trouble understand, is she's got reasons he don[Cadd9]'t.
[Em]Funny how I couldn't see it a[D]ll, '[G]til she grabbed up her c[Cadd9]oat,
And she g[G]oes.  She's been here too few [D]years,[G] to take it all in str[Cadd9]ide.
[G]Yeah, but still it's much too[D] long, to let h[Cadd9]urt go (you let her go).
[D]And we[G] al[D]ways s[CaddG]ay, it would be [G]go[D]od [Cadd9]to go away, someday,
Yeah but if there's [Em]nothin' there to [D]make things change,
if it's the [Cadd9]same for you I'll just hang, [D]same to you I'll always hang.
Well I [G]alw[D]ays s[Cadd9]ay, it would be [G]good to g[D]o aw[Cadd9]ay,
But if [Em]things don't work out [D]like we think and
There's [Em]nothing there to [D]ease this achin', but if
There's [Em]nothing there to [D]make things change,
If it's the [Cadd9]same for you I'll just hang.[Cadd9]
