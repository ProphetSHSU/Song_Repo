[Bb5]My life is a stereo, how loud does it go?
What[Ab5]songs do I know? What ever happened to my plans?
Wha[Bb5]tever happened to the life I thought I had?

My life is a stereo, kinda cheaply made though
Ho[Ab5]w bad does it show? Whatever did become of all my friends?
Wh[Bb5]atever happened to the likes of all of them?

[Bb5]My life is a stereo, turn me on and let's go
Turn[Ab5]me up louder, I'll scream as loud and clear as I can scream
And [Bb5]if you like what you're hearing, please hang on to me

[Eb5]But I like being here
And I'm all hooked up wrong
Ha[Bb5]ng on to[Ab5] me, I'm[Bb5]one in a million
On[Ab5]e in a m[Bb5]illion,
on[Ab5]e in a m[Bb5]illion[Ab5][Bb5]
Plea[Bb5]se hang on to me

[Bb5]My life is a stereo, out of phase but you know
60[Ab5]cycles humming, whatever happened to my friends?
Wh[Bb5]atever happened to the likes of all of them?

[Eb5]Oh, I like being here
And I'm all hooked up wrong

Ha[Bb5]ng on to[Ab5] me, I'm[Bb5]one in a million
On[Ab5]e in a m[Bb5]illion,
on[Ab5]e in a m[Bb5]illion[Ab5][Bb5]

[Db5]And my lights are like candles
I'm so a[Bb5]fraid of new technolo[Db5]gy
I'm in the r[Bb5]ace and I don't want to b[Db5]e
Yeah I'm so a[Bb5]fraid of what's to come for m[Db5]e
I'm in a r[Bb5]ace and I don't, I don't want to be

[Bb5]Life ends in a stereo, pack me up and let's go
Put me anywhere, please don't think of leaving me b[Ab5]ehind
Whatever happens to you, I'll get on just fi[Bb5]ne

I'm one of a million, [Bb5][Ab5]
one of a million[Ab5][Bb5]
On[Ab5]e of a m[Bb5]illion, [Ab5][Bb5]
on[Ab5]e of a m[Bb5]illion
One of a million,[Ab5] [Bb5]
one of a million[Ab5][Bb5][Ab5][Bb5]

Ooohhh
Ah, ladada
