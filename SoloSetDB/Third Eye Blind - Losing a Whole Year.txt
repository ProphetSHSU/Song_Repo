Intro:
[A/C#][E/G#]

[Badd11/D#]         Losing a whole year[A/C#]
[E/G#]     [Badd11/D#]Losing a whole year

Chorus:
[A/C#]I   remember you and me used to spend
The [E/G#]whole goddamn day in bed[Badd11/D#]
Losing a whole year
[A/C#]Hiding in your room we'd lay like dogs
And the [E/G#]phone would ring like a joke that's left unsaid[Badd11/D#]
Losing a whole year

Verse:
[A/C#]Rich daddy left you with a parachute
Your [E/G#]voice sounds like money and your face is cute
[Badd11/D#]But your daddy left you with no love
You touch everything with a velvet glove and
[A/C#]Now you wanna try your life with sin
You [E/G#]wanna be down with the down and in
[Badd11/D#]Always copping my truths
I kinda get the feeling like I'm being used

Chorus:
And [A/C#]now I realize that you never heard
[E/G#]One goddamn word I ever said[Badd11/D#]
Losing a whole year[A/C#]
[E/G#]     [Badd11/D#]Losing a whole year

Verse:
I [A/C#]took your stuff and put it in the basement
When [E/G#]I   found out what the smile on your face meant
[Badd11/D#]I seen you pop that check, hey!
Craning your neck at the car wreck
And[A/C#]it always seems that juice used to flow
In the [E/G#]car, in the kitchen you were good to go
[Badd11/D#]Now we're stuck with the tube
A sink full of dishes and some aqua lube

Chorus:
And [A/C#]I   remember you and me used to spend
The [E/G#]whole goddamn day in bed[Badd11/D#]

Bridge:
[B7sus4/A]        Hey, [A/C#]bye!

Solo:
[E/G#]     [Badd11/D#]Losing a whole year

Verse:
If it's [A/C#]not the defense then you're on the attack
When [E/G#]you start talking I hear the Prozac
[Badd11/D#]Convinced you found your place
With the pierced queer teens in cyberspace
[A/C#]When you were yourself there was tasting sweet
[E/G#]Sours into a routine deceit
Well this [Badd11/D#]drama is a bore
And I don't wanna play no more
Whoa, why[A/C#]

Chorus:
[E/G#]    Whoa, why[Badd11/D#]
Losing a whole year
[A/C#]I   remember you and me used to spend
The [E/G#]whole goddamn day in bed[Badd11/D#]

Outro:
[B7sus4/A]Hey, bye!
Hey, bye!
