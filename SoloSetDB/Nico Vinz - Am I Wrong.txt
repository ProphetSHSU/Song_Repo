Verse:
[Am]Am [F]I wrong for [Dm]thinking out the[G] box from whe[Am]re [F]I [G]stay?
[Am]Am [F]I wrong for [Dm]saying that I c[G]hoose another[Am] wa[F]y?[G]
I ain't t[Am]rying to do what e[F]verybody else [Dm]doin[G]g
Just cause eve[Am]rybody doing what they all [F]do[G]
If on[Am]e thing I k[F]now, I'll [Dm]fall but I'll [G]grow
I'm w[Am]alking down this r[F]oad of mine, this[G]road that I call home

Chorus:
So am I [Am]wro[F]ng?
For thi[Dm]nking that [G]we could [Am]be something fo[F]r [G]real?
So am I[Am] wr[F]ong?
For tryi[Dm]ng to re[G]ach the th[Am]ing[F]s [G]that I can't see?

That's just how I [Am]fee[F]l [G]
That's just how I [Am]fee[F]l
Tr[Dm]ying to reach the thi[G]ngs that I can't[Am] se[F]e[G]
