Intro:
[C][Am7][F][Am7]

Verse:
I got this [C]feeling inside my [Am7]bones
It goes e[F]lectric, wavy when I turn it [Am7]on
All through my [C]city, all through my [Am7]home
We're flying [F]up, no ceiling, when we in our [Am7]zone

Refrain 1:

I got that [C]sunshine in my pocket, got that [Am7]good song in my feet
I feel that [F]hot blood in my body when it [Am7]drops (oooh)
I can't [C]take my eyes up off it, moving [Am7]so phenomenally
Room on [F]lock the way we rock it, so don't [Am7]stop

Pre-Chorus 1:

And under the [Bb/C]lights when everything [C]goes
Nowhere to [Bb/C]hide when I'm getting you [C]close
When we [Ab/Bb]move, well, you already [Bb]know
So just i[Fm7]magine, just imagine, just i[Ab/Bb]magine

Chorus 1:

[C]Nothing I can see but you when you [Am7]dance, dance, dance
Feeling [F]good, good, creeping up on you, so just [Am7]dance, dance, dance, come on
[C]All those things I shouldn’t do, but you [Am7]dance, dance, dance
And [F]ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep [Am7]dancing
I can't stop the [C]feeling, so just [Am7]dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the [F]feeling, so just [Am7]dance, dance, dance, come on

Verse:
[C]  Ooh, it's something magi[Am7]cal
It's in the [F]air, it's in my blood, it's rushing [Am7]on
I don't need no [C]reason, don't need con[Am7]trol
I fly so [F]high, no ceiling, when I'm in my [Am7]zone

Refrain 2:

Cause I got that [C]sunshine in my pocket, got that [Am7]good song in my feet
I feel that [F]hot blood in my body when it [Am7]drops
I can't [C]take my eyes up off it, moving [Am7]so phenomenally
Room on [F]lock the way we rock it, so don't [Am7]stop

Pre-Chorus 2:

And under the [Bb/C]lights when everything [C]goes
Nowhere to [Bb/C]hide when I'm getting you [C]close
When we [Ab/Bb]move, well, you already [Bb]know
So just i[Fm7]magine, just imagine, just i[Ab/Bb]magine
Chorus 2:

[C]Nothing I can see but you when you [Am7]dance, dance, dance
Feeling [F]good, good, creeping up on you, so just [Am7]dance, dance, dance, come on
[C]All those things I shouldn’t do, but you [Am7]dance, dance, dance
And [F]ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep [Am7]dancing
I can't stop the [C]feeling, so just [Am7]dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the [F]feeling, so just [Am7]dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the [C]feeling, so just [Am7]dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the [F]feeling, so keep [Am7]dancing, come on

Breakdown:

[C]   [Am7]Oh
[F]   [Am7]I can't stop the
[C]   [Am7]I can't stop the
[F]   [Am7]    I can't stop the, [N.C.]I can't stop the

Chorus 3:

(I can't stop the feeling) [C]Nothing I can see but you when you [Am7]dance, dance, dance, feeling
(I can't stop the feeling) [F]Good, good, creeping up on you, so just [Am7]dance, dance, dance, come on
(I can't stop the feeling) [C]All those things I shouldn’t do, but you [Am7]dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling) And [F]ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep [Am7]dancing

Outro:
Everybody sing
(I can't stop the [C]feeling) Got this feeling in my [Am7]body
