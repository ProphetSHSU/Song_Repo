[F][Am][C][C]

[F][Am][C][C]

Verse:
[F]I'm just a [Am]sailor swimming [C]backwards
[F]I'm just a [Am]fish out in the [C]sea
[F]I'm just a [Am]preacher in the [G]graveyard
[F]Telling everyone but [C]God to follow [G]me

Verse:
[F]I'm just a [Am]liar who got [C]lucky
[F]I ain't no [Am]different from the [C]rest
[F]I might be [Am]jaded and de[G]lusional
But at [F]least I found a [C]home inside my [G]head

Pre-Chorus:
This is for [F]all those [C]dreams I be[G]lieved in
This is for [F]all those [C]doubts in my [G]mind
This is the [F]wild wild [C]world that we [G]live in
I won't let [Am]anyone tell [C]me I won't [G]survive

Chorus:
I'll be just [Am]fine[C][G][G]
I'll be just [Am]fine[C][G][G]

Verse:
[F]I miss the [Am]permanence of [C]failure
[F]I miss the [Am]honesty of [C]pain
[F]But I sever [Am]ties with all my [G]anger
So I [F]guess it's just the [C]world we'll have to [G]blame

Pre-Chorus:
This is for [F]all those [C]dreams I be[G]lieved in
This is for [F]all those [C]doubts in my [G]mind
This is the [F]wild wild [C]world that we [G]live in
I won't let [Am]anyone tell [C]me I won't sur[G]vive

Chorus:
I'll be just [Am]fine[C][G][G]
I'll be just [Am]fine[C][G][G]
I'll be just [Am]fine[C][G][G]
I'll be just [Am]fine[C][G][G][G][G]

(I'll be just fine)

Bridge:
[Dm]Point your [Am]fingers like a [G]gun
[Dm]Ain't it [Am]sweet to be some[G]one
[Dm]Take your last [Am]breath to mend the [G]fall

Pre-Chorus:
'Cause this is for [F]all those [C]lives I be[G]lieved in
This is for [F]all those [C]doubts in my [G]mind
This is the [F]last damn [C]thing that I hold [G]close to me
I won't let [F]anyone so [C]wrong tell me what's [G]right

Pre-Chorus:
And this is for [F]all those [C]dreams I be[G]lieved in
This is for [F]all those [C]doubts in my [G]mind
This is the [F]wild wild [C]world that we're, we [G]living in
I won't let [Am]anyone so [C]wrong tell me what's [G]right

Chorus / Ending:
I'll be just [Am]fine[C][G][G]
I'll be just [Am]fine[C][G][G]
I'll be just [Am]fine[C][G][G]
I won't let [Am]anyone tell [C]me I won't [G]survive
I won't [Am]let anyone t[C]ell me that I ai[G]n't fine
