[F][C][G]

[F]

Verse:
[C/G]Mary Anne and Wanda were the [C]best of friends
All[C/G]   through their high school days[G][Gadd11]
[C/G]   Both members of the [F]4 H Club
Both ac[C/G]tive in the [G]FFA[C/G]
After graduation Mary [F]Anne went out
Loo[C/G]kin' for a bright new world[G][Gadd11]
[C/G]   Wanda looked all around[F]this town
And all[C/G]   she found[G] was Earl[C/G]

Verse:
Well it [C/G]wasn't two weeks after [F]she got married
That Wan[C/G]da started gettin' abused[G]
She put on [C/G]dark glasses and long[F]sleeved blouses
And make[C/G]up to [G]cover a bruise[C/G]
Well she finally got the nerve to file[F]for divorce
She [C/G]let the law take it from there[G]
But Earl [C/G]walked right through that restrai[F]ning order
And put [C/G]her in inten[G]sive care[C/G]

Pre-Chorus:
Right a[Am]way, Mary Anne flew [G]in from Atlanta
On a red[F]eye midnight flight[C]
She held [Am]Wanda's hand and they worked[G]out a plan
And it did[F]n't take 'em long to decide[G]
That Earl had to [C]die

Chorus:
[F]  [C] Good[G]bye, Earl[F]
Those blackeyed [C]peas
[F] They tasted [C]all right to [G]me, Earl[F]
You're feeling weak[C]
[F] Why don't you [C]lay down and [G]sleep, Earl?[F]
Ain't it dark[C]
[F] Wrapped [C]up in that[G] tarp, Earl?[F]

{c: JUST BASS}
Verse:
[C]  [F]  [C]  [Fmaj7/C]       The [C/G]cops came by to bring[F]Earl in
They [C/G]searched the house high and low
[G] Then they tipped[C/G]their hats
And said "Thank[F] You ladies, if you hear[C/G]   from him let [G]us know"

Verse:
[C/G]   Well the [C/G]weeks went by and
Spring[F]turned to summer
And sum[C/G]mer faded into fall[G]
[F]And it turns[C/G]   out he was a mis[F]sing person
Who no[C/G]body missed[C] at all[C/G]

Pre-Chorus:
So the [Am]girls bought some land at a [G]roadside stand
Out [F]on Highway 1 0 9[C]
They sell [Am]Tennessee ham
And straw[G]berry jam
And they don't[F] lose any sleep at night,[G]'cause
Earl had to [C]die

Chorus:
[F]  [C] Good[G]bye Earl[F]
We need a break
[C]  [F] Let's go [C]out to the [G]lake, Earl[F]
We'll pack a lunch
[C]  [F] And stuff [C]you in the [G]trunk, Earl[F]
Well, is that all [C]right?
[F]Good, let's [C]go for a [G]ride Earl[F]
Hey

Solo Banjo:
[G]  [F]  [C]  [G]  [F] Well hey, hey, hey[C]
