Verse:
[C]Slip inside the[G] eye of you[Am]r mind
Don't you[E7] know you migh[F]t find
[G]A better place to[C] play[Am][G]
[C]You said tha[G]t you'd nev[Am]er been
But all the [E7]things that you'[F]ve seen
[G]Slowly fade [C]away[Am][G]

Verse:
[F]So I start a rev[Fm]olution from[C]my bed
Cos you [F]said the brains [Fm]I had went to[C]my head
[F]Step outside, th[Fm]e summertime's[C]in bloom
[G]Stand up beside the fireplace
[E7]Take that look from off your face
Cos [Am.]you ain't ever[G] gonna burn [F]my heart[G]out

Chorus 1:
[C]So S[G]ally can[Am] wait, she[E7] knows it's t[F]oo late
as she's [G]walking o[C]n by[Am][G]
Her [C]soul [G]slides[Am] away[E7],       but don't l[F]ook back in[G]anger
I heard you[C] say[G][Am][E7][F][G][C][Am][G]

Verse:
[C]Take me to the[G] place where [Am]you go
Where [E7]nobod[F]y know[G]s,   if it's night[C] or d[Am]ay[G]
[C]Please don't put you[G]r life in t[Am]he hands
of a r[E7]ock and roll[F] ba[G]nd,    who'll throw it[C] all a[Am]way[G]

Verse:
[F]So I start a rev[Fm]olution from[C]my bed
Cos you [F]said the brains [Fm]I had went to[C]my head
[F]Step outside, th[Fm]e summertime's[C]in bloom
[G]Stand up beside the fireplace
[E7]Take that look from off your face
Cos [Am.]you ain't ever[G] gonna burn [F]my heart[G]out

Chorus 2:
[C]So S[G]ally can[Am] wait, she[E7] knows it's t[F]oo late
as she's [G]walking o[C]n by[Am][G]
Her [C]soul [G]slides[Am] away[E7],       but don't l[F]ook back in[G]anger
I heard you[C] say[G][Am][E7][F][G][C][Am][G]

Chorus 3:
[C]So S[G]ally ca[Am]n wait, sh[E7]e knows it's t[F]oo late
as she's [G]walking o[C.]n by[Am][G]
Her [C]soul [G]slides[Am] away[E7],       but don't l[F]ook back in anger
don't look[Fm]back in anger
I heard you[C] say  [G]  [Am]   [E7]      [F]  [Fm]         least [C]not today
