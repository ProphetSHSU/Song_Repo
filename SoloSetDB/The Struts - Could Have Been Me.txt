[E]Don't wanna live as an untold story
Rather go out in a blaze glory
[A]I can't hear you, I don't fear you

Verse:
[E]I'll live now cause the bad die last
Dodging bullets with your broken past

What a wa[D]ste of blood and sw[A]eat
[B]Oh oh oh...

Chorus:
I wanna taste l[E]ove and pain
I wanna feel pride and shame
I don't wanna t[Dbm]ake my time

It could have been [A]me
It could have been [B]me
Yeah

[E]Don't wanna wake up on monday morning
The thought of work is getting my skin crawling
