Verse:
[G]Call me c[A]razy if you've [Bm]got it in you
but these pe[G]ople don't se[A]em to mi[D]nd
[G]sweet verm[A]outh now you're tel[Bm]ling me the truth
a little stubb[G]ornness will w[A]ork out fi[D]ne
[G]a bottom fe[A]eder at the e[Bm]nd of my rope
but I'm wonde[G]ring where this r[A]ope be[D]gan
[G]gonna circle aro[A]und what i co[Bm]uldn't help bring down
it's j[G]ust supply wi[A]th dem[D]and

Pre Chorus:
[A]ooh...not[D]hing looks the s[G]ame
[A]ooh...even w[D]hen there's been no ch[G]ange
[A]ooh...say that some[D]thing's gonna g[G]ive
and it's a[Em]ll giving out on yo[A]u

Chorus:
when it's a[G]ll o[A]ver n[Bm]ow

i guess i'm go[G]nna have to li[A]ve with th[D]at
[G]short cha[A]nged now it's get[Bm]ting even harder
to id[G]entify the [A]repetitio[D]n
[G]short cha[A]nged now it's get[Bm]ting even harder to identify the repetition

Pre Chorus:
[A]ooh...will i si[D]mply peel aw[G]ay

Bridge:
[Em]and if yo[A]u came here to te[D]ll me tha[A]t you're sor[Bm]ry

         G    A    D
