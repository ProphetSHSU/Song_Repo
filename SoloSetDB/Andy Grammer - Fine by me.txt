Verse:
Y[G]ou[D]'r[F]e [C]not the type
Type of girl to remain
With the guy, with the guy too shy
Too afraid to say, he'll give his heart to you forever
I'm not the boy that will fall to his knees
With his hands clenched tight
Begging, begging you please
To stay with? him for worse and for better

Pre-Chorus:
[Em]But[D] I[C]'m[D]staring at you now
There's no one else around 
I'm thinking you're the girl for me 

Chorus:
I'm just saying it's f[C]ine [D]by m[G]e
If you [C]neve[D]r le[G]ave
And? we can l[Em]ive l[D]ike t[C]his forever
It's [C]fine [D]by [G]me

Verse:
[G]In[D] t[F]he[C]past I would try
Try hard to commit to a girl 
Wouldn't get too far 
And it always somehow seemed to fall apart 

And with you, you, you 
I can see what I need 
I can dream realistically 
I knew that this was different from the start 

And it seems that every time 
We're eye to eye 
I can find another piece of you 
That I don't wanna lose 

Pre-Chorus:
[Em]And[D]? [C]I'[D]m staring at you now
There's no one else around 
I'm thinking you're the girl I need 

Chorus:
I'm just saying it's [C]fine[D] by [G]me
If you [C]neve[D]r le[G]ave
And? we can l[Em]ive l[D]ike t[C]his forever
It's [C]fine [D]by [G]me
I'm just saying it's f[C]ine [D]by m[G]e
If you [C]neve[D]r le[G]ave
And? we can l[Em]ive l[D]ike t[C]his forever
It's [C]fine [D]by [G]me
Bridge:
[Em]And[Em] it[B7]'s [B7]nev[G]er[G] e[A]as[A]y
Darling, believe me 
I'm as skeptical as you 
When I think of life without 'us' 
She's like "what we supposed to do?" 
But I[C] don't wanna come on too [D]st[D]ro[D]ng[D][D][stop]

N.C.
I'm just saying it's fine by me 
If you never leave 
We can live like this forever 
It's fine by me 

Chorus:
I'm just saying it's f[C]ine [D]by m[G]e
If you [C]neve[D]r le[G]ave
And? we can l[Em]ive l[D]ike t[C]his forever
It's [C]fine [D]by [G]me
I'm just saying it's f[C]ine [D]by m[G]e
If you [C]neve[D]r le[G]ave
And? we can l[Em]ive l[D]ike t[C]his forever
It's [C]fine [D]by [G]me[(stop)]
