Verse 1:
{c:‘cutting’ vocal note is an open G}
I was [D]cutting the rug
Down at a place called The Jug
With a [A]girl named Linda Lu
When [D]in walked a man
With a gun in his hand
And he was [E]looking for you know who[A]
He said, he[D]y there fellow
With the hair colored yellow
[G] What you trying to pro[E]ve?
'Cause that's [D]my woman there
And I'm a man who cares
And this [A]might be all for you[D]

(I said excuuuuuse me - quiet)

Verse 2:
I was [D]scared and fearing for my life
I was [A]shaking like a leaf on a tree
'Cause he was [D]lean, mean
Big and bad, Lord
[E]Pointing that gun at me[A]
Oh, [D]wait a minute, mister
I didn't even kiss her
[G] Don't want no trouble with you[E]
And I know[D]you don't owe me
But I wish you would let me
[A]Ask one favor from you[D]

 
 
Chorus:
Oh, won't you [D]give me three steps
Gimme three steps mister
Gimme [A]three steps towards the door?
[D]Gimme three steps
Gimme three steps mister
And you'll [A]never seea me no mo[D]re
For sure!

Verse 3:
Well the [D]crowd cleared away
And I began to pray
As the wa[A]ter fell on the floor
And I'm [D]telling you son
Well, it ain't no fun
Staring [E]straight down a fortyfou[A]r
Well he tu[D]rned and screamed at Linda Lu
And that's the [G]break I was looking fo[E]r
And you could [D]hear me screaming a mile away
As I was [A]headed out towards the doo[D]r

 
 
Chorus:
Oh, won't you [D]give me three steps
Gimme three steps mister
Gimme [A]three steps towards the door?
[D]Gimme three steps
Gimme three steps mister
And you'll [A]never seea me no mo[D]re
Show me the back door
