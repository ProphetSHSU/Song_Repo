Intro:
[C][G][F5][C][G]
[C][G][F5][C][G]

Verse:
[C]I am thinking it's a [G]sign that the freckles
in our [F5]eyes are mirror images and [C]when
we kiss they're [G]perfectly aligned
And [C]I have to specu[G]late that God himself
did [F5]make us into corresponding [C]shapes like
puzzle [G]pieces from the clay
[C]True it may seem like a [G]stretch, but
its thoughts like this that [F5]catch my troubled
head when you're [C]away when I am [G]missing you to death
[C]When you are out there on the [G]road for
several weeks of [F5]shows, and when you scan
the radi[C]o I hope this [G]song will guide you home

Chorus:
[C]They will see us waving from [G]such great
heights, "come d[F5]own now" they'll s[C]ay[G]
but [C]everything looks perfect from [G]far away,
"come d[F5]own now", but we'll st[C]ay[G]

Verse:
[C]I tried my best to [G]leave this song on your
mac[F5]hine but the persistent beat it [C]sounded
thin [G]upon listening
[C]That frankly will not [G]fly. you will hear
the shrillest [F5]highs and lowest lows with
the win[C]dows down when this [G]is guiding you home

Chorus:
[C]They will see us waving from [G]such great
heights, "come d[F5]own now" they'll s[C]ay[G]
but [C]everything looks perfect from [G]far away,
"come d[F5]own now", but we'll st[C]ay[G]
