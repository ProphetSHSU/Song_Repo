[B][E][B][F#]

Chorus 1:
[B] I got my [B]toes in the water,
 a[E]ss in the sand
Not a wo[B]rry in [F#add11/A#]the world,[G#m]
a cold [F#]beer in my hand
Life is goo[E]d today,[F#]life is good today

Verse:
[B] Well, the pla[B]ne touched down 
just abou[E]t three o'clock
And the ci[B]ty's still on my mi[F#]nd

Bi[B]kinis and palm trees da[E]nced in my head
I was sti[B]ll in the ba[F#]ggage li[B]ne

Co[B]ncrete and cars are their ow[E]n prison bars
Like thi[B]s life I'm living i[F#]n

But the [B]plane brought me farther, 
I'm sur[E]rounded by water
And I[B]'m not going[F#]  back agai[B]n

Chorus 1:
I got my [B]toes in the water, 
a[E]ss in the sand
Not a wo[B]rry in [F#add11/A#]the world,[G#m]   
a cold [F#]beer in my hand
Life is goo[E]d today,[F#]life is good today
[B] Adios and vaya con [E]Dios

Chorus 2:
Yeah, I'm leaving GA[B]
And if it were[F#]n't for tequila 
and pretty señoritas
I'd have no reason to [B]stay
Adios and vaya con [E]Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA[B]
Going to [F#]lay in the hot sun 
and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and [B]play

[E][B][F#][B]

[E][B][F#][B]

Verse:
Four da[B]ys flew by like a dru[E]nk Friday night
As the su[B]mmer drew to an e[F#]nd
The[B]y can't believe that I ju[E]st couldn't leave
And I bi[B]d adieu[F#]  to my frie[B]nds
Cause my[B] bartender, she[E]'s from the islands
Her [B]body's been kissed by the su[F#]n
And [B]coconut replaces the sme[E]ll of the bar
And I do[B]n't know if it's her[F#]  or the ru[B]m

Chorus 1:
I got my [B]toes in the water, 
a[E]ss in the sand
Not a wo[B]rry in [F#add11/A#]the world,[G#m]   
a cold [F#]beer in my hand
Life is goo[E]d today,[F#]life is good today
[B] Adios and vaya con [E]Dios

Chorus 2:
A long way from GA[B]
Yes, and [F#]all the muchachas, 
they call me big papa
When I throw pesos their [B]way

Adios and vaya con [E]Dios
A long way from GA[B]
Someone [F#]do me a favor and pour me some Jaeger
And I'll grab my guitar and [B]play

Post-Chorus:
[E][B][F#][B]
[E][B][F#][B]


Chorus 2:
Adios and vaya con [E]Dios
Going home now to sta[B]y
The seño[F#]ritas don't careo 
when there's no dinero
Yeah, I got no money to [B]stay
Adios and vaya con [E]Dios
Going home now to sta[B]y
[F#]I'm just going to drive up by the lake

Outro:
And put my [B]ass in a lawn chair, 
toe[E]s in the clay
Not a wo[B]rry in [F#add11/A#]the world,[G#m]   
a PB[F#]R on the way
Life is goo[E]d today,[F#]  
life is good today.
[B][E][F#][B]
