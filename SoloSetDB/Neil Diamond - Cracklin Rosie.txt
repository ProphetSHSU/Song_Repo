[C]Cracklin' Rosie, get on board
We're gonna ride till there ain't no more to [F]go

Taking it slow, Lord don't you know
[Dm]   Have me a time with a [G7]poor man's lady

[C]Hitchin' on a twilight train
Ain't nothing there that I care to take al[F]ong

Maybe a song, to sing when I want
Don't [Dm]need to say please to no [G7]man for a happy [C]tune

[C]Oh, I [F]love my [G]Rosie [C]child
[C]She got the[F] way to [G]make me [C]happy
[C]You and [F]me, we [G]go in [C]style

[Dm]Cracklin' Rosie you're a store-bought woman

You make me sing like a guitar hummin'

So hang on to me, girl
Our song keeps runnin’ [G]on

Play it now
Play it now
Play it now, my baby

[C]Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile
Girl if it lasts for an hour, that's all [F]right

We got all night to set the world right
[Dm]  Find us a dream that don't [G7]ask no questions, [C]yeah

[C]Oh, I [F]love my [G]Rosie [C]child
[C]She got the [F]way to [G]make me [C]happy
[C]You and [F]me, we [G]go in [C]style

[Dm]Cracklin' Rosie, you're a store-bought woman

You make me sing like a guitar hummin’

So hang on to me, girl
Our song keeps runnin’ [G]on

Play it now
Play it now my baby
[C]Cracklin' Rosie, make me a smile
Girl if it lasts for an hour, that's all [F]right

We got all night to set the world right
[Dm]  Find us a dream that don't [G7]ask no questions, [C]yeah
