[Am][C][G]

[Am][C][E][Am][Am/G][F][Fm][C/G]

Verse:
[C/G]Love of mine
someday [Am/E]you will die,
but I'll be [F]close behind;
I'll follow y[C]ou into the d[G]ark.
No [C/G]blinding light
or tunnels to [Am/E]gates of white,
just our hands [F]clasped so tight
waiting f[C]or the hint of a sp[G]ark.

Chorus:
If he[Am]aven and hell dec[C]ide that they b[F]oth are satisf[C]ied,[G/B]
il[Am]luminate the [C]noes on their v[G]acancy signs.
If th[Am]ere's no one bes[C]ide you when your [E]soul em[Am]barks[Am/G]
then [F]I'll follow [Fm]you into the [C/G]dark.

Verse:
In [C/G]Catholic school,
as vicious as [Am/E]Roman rule,
I got my k[F]nuckles bruised
by a [C]lady in b[G]lack.
And I [C/G]held my tongue
as she [Am/E]told me "Son,
fear is the [F]heart of love".
So I [C]never went [G]back.

Chorus:
If he[Am]aven and hell dec[C]ide that they b[F]oth are satisf[C]ied,[G/B]
il[Am]luminate the [C]noes on their v[G]acancy signs.
If th[Am]ere's no one bes[C]ide you when your [E]soul em[Am]barks[Am/G]
then [F]I'll follow [Fm]you into the [C/G]dark.

Verse:
[C/G]You and me
have seen everyt[Am/E]hing to see
from Bangkok to [F]Calgary,
and the [C]soles of your [G]shoes
are a[C/G]ll worn down.
The time for [Am/E]sleep is now
but it's nothing to [F]cry about
'cause we'll [C]hold each other [G]soon
in the [Am]blackest of [F]rooms.

Chorus:
If he[Am]aven and hell dec[C]ide that they b[F]oth are satisf[C]ied,[G/B]
il[Am]luminate the [C]noes on their v[G]acancy signs.
If th[Am]ere's no one bes[C]ide you when your [E]soul em[Am]barks[Am/G]
Then [F]I'll follow [Fm]you into the [C]dark[G/B][Am]
Then [F]I'll follow [Fm]you into the [C/G]dark
