Intro:
[D5]

Main Riff:
[D5][Bb/D][D5][Bb/D]

[D5] [Bb/D][D5][Bb/D]

Verse:
[D5]There's a shadow just behind me
[Bb/D]Shrouding every step I take
Making every promise empty
Pointing every finger at me
Waiting like a stalking butler
Who upon the finger rests
Murder now the path called must we
Just before the son has come

Pre-Chorus:
[D5]Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
[Eb5]Something but the past is done?
[D5]Jesus, won't you fucking whistle
[Eb5]Something but the past is done?

Chorus:
[D5]Why can't we not[Eb5]be sober?
I [D5]just want to start[Eb5]this over
[D5]Why can't we drink[Eb5]forever?
I [D5]just want to start[Eb5]this over

Main Riff:
[D5] [Bb/D][D5][Bb/D]

Verse:
[D5]I am just a worthless liar
[Bb/D]I   am just an imbecile
I will only complicate you
Trust in me and fall as well
I will find a center in you
I will chew it up and leave
I will work to elevate you
Just enough to bring you down

Pre-Chorus:
[D5]Mother Mary won't you whisper
[Eb5]Something but the past is done?
[D5]Mother Mary won't you whisper
[Eb5]Something but the past is done?

Chorus:
[D5]Why can't we not[Eb5]be sober?
I [D5]just want to start[Eb5]this over
[D5]Why can't we drink[Eb5]forever?
I [D5]just want to start[Eb5]this over
