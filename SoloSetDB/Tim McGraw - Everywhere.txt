Verse:
We were born in[G] this little town, Growin up I was countin' down[F]
Every single day,[F]  til we mad our [C]get away[C][G]

This would be your home,[F]  and I was [C]on my own[C][D]

Pre-Chorus:

I've seen you in[G]

Albuquerque [G]waitin' out a blizzard[Em7]
Arizona [Em7]dancin cross the desert[C]
Watchin' the sun set [C]in Monterrey[D]
Girl I swear just the [D]other day you were

In my heart I'll [D]always see you [G]  every[C]where[G][C][G]

Verse:
Now days when [G]I'm passin' through, the converstion always turns to you
[F]And I hear you're doing fine,[F]  livin' out by the [C]county line[C][G]

That you want to lead,[F]  guess you could say the [C]same for me[C][D]
