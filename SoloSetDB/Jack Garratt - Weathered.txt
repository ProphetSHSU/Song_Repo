[C]  When I grow old I'll dri[F/C]nk and smoke[C]
Like I did when youth stayed, youth stayed[Am]
Til the [F]second round[C]
[C]  When I grow old the s[F/C]un will cope[C]
Shine on every youth stain, youth stain[Am]
Never [F]settling down[C]

[C/E]And no [F’]wonder I keep you [C]close
[C/E]You're the [F’]water to quench my [C]throat[G]
And [Am]if [G’]I  [F]never [G]let you [Am]go
Will you [G’]keep me [F]young,[Fsus2]      keep [C]  me young[F/C]

[C]  When I grow old my we[F/C]athered soul[C]
And memories re-[C]cluse, [C’]e- [Am]lu-[G]sive[F]
Help me dig [C]  them out[F/C]
[C]  So keep me young and call [F/C]my bluffs[C]
And help me out when [C]you [C’]say, [Am]you[G]    [F]say
There's no room [C]for doubt
[C/E]Say I'm[F’] stronger and keep me [C]close
And [C/E]be the [F’]water and test my [C]  coat[G]
And [Am]if [G’]I  [F]never [G]let you [Am]go
Will you [G’]keep me [F]young,[Fsus2]      keep [C]me young

[Am]Oh, when my [G]heart stops [F]beating[C]
And my blood [F/C]turns [C]cold
And, [Am]oh, when my [G]heart stops [F]beating[C]
And my breath [F/C]won't [C]flow
And, [Am]oh, when my [G]heart stops [C/E’]beating[F]
When you go, I’ll know I’m...

[Am]Oh, when my [G]heart stops [F]beating[C]
And my blood [F/C]turns [C]cold
And, [Am]oh, when my [G]heart stops [F]beating[C]
And my breath [F/C]won't [C]flow
And, [Am]oh, when my [G]heart stops [C/E’]beating[F]

When you go, I’ll know I’m...

[C]When I grow old, I'll drink and smoke
But just as long as [C]you [C’]stay, [Am]you [G]stay[F]
I've found a way out[C]
