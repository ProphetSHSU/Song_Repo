Verse:
[D]I’ve been sitting [A]around for [G]way too [A]long
And the [D]world is looking [A]like it’s getting [G]smaller by the [A]minute
I am b[D]ound up in c[A]hains, and [G]I just [A]have to [D]say
Let me [A]run like the [G]horses [A]on the [D]range
And I [A]promise you I’ll [G]never, [A]ever com[D]plain[A][G][A]
Let me [D]run [A]from a[G]ll these years of [A]wasted s[D]pace
And I’ll pr[A]omise you I’ll n[G]ever, [A]ever ch[D]ange[A][G][A]

Verse:
These [D]chains that are [A]holding me [G]make it so [A]hard for me to
Br[D]eathe the [A]air that m[G]ost of [A]us do not [D]see
I’ll speak for [A]all, conf[G]ined by these w[A]alls which has
[D]Held us [A]to a h[G]umili[A]ating cr[D]awl
There ain’t no [A]doubt; [G]once I get [A]out
I’m gonna [D]run [A]like the h[G]orses [A]on the r[D]ange
And I [A]promise you I’ll [G]never, [A]ever com[D]plain[A][G][A]
Let me [D]run [A]from a[G]ll these years of [A]wasted s[D]pace
And I’ll pr[A]omise you I’ll n[G]ever, [A]ever ch[D]ange[A][G][A]
