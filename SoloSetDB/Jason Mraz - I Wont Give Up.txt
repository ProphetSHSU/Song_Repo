Intro:
[Dsus4][D][Dsus4][D]
[Dsus4] [D][Asus4][A]

Verse:
When I look into[Dsus4] your e[D]yes, It's like watching the[Dsus4] night sk[D]y,
Or a beautifu[Dsus4]l sunri[D]se. There's so much they [Asus4]hold.[A]
And just like the[Dsus4]m old st[D]ars, I see that you've[Dsus4] come so f[D]ar,
To be right wher[Dsus4]e you a[D]re. How old is your [Asus4]soul?[A]

Chorus:
I won't give [G]up on [D]us, even if the sk[Bm]ies get r[A]ough.
I'm giving you [G]all my l[D]ove. I'm still looking[Asus4] up.[A]

Verse:
And when you're needing[Dsus4] your sp[D]ace, to do som[Dsus4]e navig[D]ating,
I'll be here[Dsus4] patiently w[D]aiting, to see what you [Asus4]find.[A]

Chorus:
'Cause even the st[G]ars they b[D]urn. Some even f[Bm]all to the e[A]arth.
We've got a l[G]ot to l[D]earn. God knows we're[Asus4] worth it.[A]
No, I won't give[Gmaj7]up.

Bridge:
I don't [Em]wanna be someone who walks away so easily,
I'm here to stay and make the difference that [A]I can make.
Our [Em]differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use
the tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a l[A]ot at stake.
And in the [C]end you're still my friend, at least we did intend

for us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn.
  [C#dim(A7)]We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in.
[C]  I had to learn what I got[C#dim(A7)], and what I'm not and [N.C.]who I am.[D]

Chorus:
I won't give [G]up on [D]us, even if the sk[Bm]ies get r[A]ough.
I'm giving you [G]all my l[D]ove. I'm still looking[Bm7]up.
Still looking [A]up.

I won't give[G] up on[D]us (no I'm not... giving up)
God knows I'm t[Bm]ough en[A]ough (I am tough... I am loved)
We've got a l[G]ot to l[D]earn (we're alive... we are loved)
God knows we're w[A]orth it (and we're worth it)

I won't give [G]up on [D]us, even if the sk[Bm]ies get r[A]ough.
I'm giving you [G]all my l[D]ove. I'm still looking [A]up.
