Well they come and pull me from my [A]house
And they drag my body through the [D]streets
And the sun’s so hot I think I’ll [E]catch fire and [D]burn up
in the summer air so moist and [A]sweet

And the people all come out to [A]cheer
Rocks in the pathway break my [D]skin
And there’s honeysuckle on the [E]faint breeze [D]today
With every breath I’m drawing [A]in

I want to [F#m]cry out but I don’t [D]scream and I don’t shout
And I feel [A]so proud to be [D]alive
And I feel [A]so [E]proud to when the [D]reckoning arrives

[A][D]

[A][D]

Crowds grow denser by the [A]second
As we near the center of the [D]town
And they dig a trench right in the [E]main square right [D]there
And they pick me up and throw me [A]down

And I start laughing like a [A]child
And I mark their faces one by [D]one
Transfigurations gonna [E]come for me at [D]last
And I will burn hotter than the [A]sun

I waited [F#m]so long and now I taste [D]jasmine on my tongue
And I feel [A]so proud to be [D]alive
And I feel [A]so [E]proud when the [D]reckoning arrives

[A][D]
