[G][D][C][D]

[G]Six lanes, t[D]ail lights, [Em]red ants marching in[C]to the night
[G]They disappear to the l[D]eft and right ag[C]ain
[G]Another supper [D]from a sack, a [Em]ninety-nine cent [C]heart attack
[G]I got a pounding head and and a[D]ching back
And the c[C]amel's b[G]uried in a [Am]big straw s[D]tack

Chorus:
But [G]I'm gonna live where the g[D]reen grass grows
[C]Watch my corn pop [D]up in rows
[G]Every night be t[D]ucked in close to y[C]ou[D]
[G]Raise our kids where the [D]good Lord's blessed
[C]Point our rocking chairs t[D]owards the west
[G]Plant our dreams where the p[D]eaceful river fl[C]ows[G]
Where the g[Am]reen g[D]rass gr[G]ows

[G][D][Em][C]
[G] [D][C][D]

[G]Well I'm from, a m[D]ap dot, a s[Em]top sign on a b[C]lacktop
[G]I caught the first bus [D]I could hop from [C]there
[G]But all of this glitter is [D]getting dark
[Em]There's concrete growing in the [C]city park
[G]I don't know who my [D]neighbors are
And there's b[C]ars on the d[G]oors and [Am]bars on my h[D]eart

Chorus:
But [G]I'm gonna live where the g[D]reen grass grows
[C]Watch my corn pop [D]up in rows
[G]Every night be t[D]ucked in close to y[C]ou[D]
[G]Raise our kids where the [D]good Lord's blessed
[C]Point our rocking chairs t[D]owards the west
[G]Plant our dreams where the p[D]eaceful river fl[C]ows[G]

Chorus:
But [G]I'm gonna live where the g[D]reen grass grows
[C]Watch my corn pop [D]up in rows
[G]Every night be t[D]ucked in close to y[C]ou[D]
[G]Raise our kids where the [D]good Lord's blessed
[C]Point our rocking chairs t[D]owards the west
[G]Plant our dreams where the p[D]eaceful river fl[C]ows[G]
Where the g[Am]reen g[D]rass gr[G]ows
