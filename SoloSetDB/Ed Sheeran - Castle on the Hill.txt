Intro:
[D]

Verse:
[D]  When I was six [D/F#]years [G]old I broke my leg[Bm][A]
[D]  And I was runn[D/F#]ing  [G]from my brother and h[Bm]is friends[A]
[D]  And tasted [D/F#]the sw[G]eet perfume of the m[Bm]ountain grass as I [A]rolled down
[D]  I was youn[D/F#]ger  t[G]hen,[Bm]  take me back to w[A]hen I

Pre-Chorus 1:
[G]  Found my h[A]eart and broke it h[D]ere
  Made friends and l[G]ost them through the years
[G]  And I've not s[A]een the roaring f[D]ields in so long, I[G]know I've grown
[G]  But I can't w[A]ait to go home

Chorus 1:
  [D]I'm on [D/F#]my   [G]way, [Bm]driving at [A7sus4]ninety
  Down [D]those coun[D/F#]try  [G]lanes [Bm]singing to [A7sus4]Tiny Dancer
  And [D]I miss [D/F#]the  [G]way you make[Bm]  me feel[A7sus4]and it's real
  When [D]we watched [D/F#]the  [G]sunset [Bm]over the c[A7sus4]astle on the hill[D]

Verse:
[D]  Fifteen [D/F#]years [G]old and smoking [Bm]hand-rolled cigarettes[A]
[D]  Running from [D/F#]the law[G] through the backfields and[Bm]  getting drunk with my [A]friends
[D]  Had my [D/F#]first k[G]iss on a Friday n[Bm]ight, I don't r[A]eckon I did it
[D]Right, I was youn[D/F#]ger  [G]then,[Bm]  take me back to w[A]hen we found

Pre-Chorus 2:
[G]  Weekend j[A]obs and when we got p[D]aid
  We'd buy cheap s[G]pirits and drink them s[G]traight
  Me and my f[A]riends have not thrown u[D]p in so long, o[G]h how we've grown
[G]  But I can't [A]wait to go home

Chorus 2:
  [D]I'm on [D/F#]my   [G]way, [Bm]driving at [A7sus4]ninety
  Down [D]those coun[D/F#]try  [G]lanes [Bm]singing to [A7sus4]Tiny Dancer
  And [D]I miss [D/F#]the  [G]way you make[Bm]  me feel[A7sus4]and it's real
  [D]We watched [D/F#]the  [G]sunset [Bm]over the c[A7sus4]astle on the hill
  [D]   [D/F#]     [G]    [Bm]Over the c[A7sus4]astle on the hill
  [D]   [D/F#]     [G]    [Bm]Over the c[A7sus4]astle on the hill
Bridge:
[Bm][G][D][A7sus4]

[Bm]   One friend l[G]eft to sell clothes,[D] one works d[A7sus4]own by the coast
[Bm]   One had two k[G]ids but lives alone,[D] one's b[A7sus4]rother overdosed
[Bm]   One's al[G]ready on his second wife,[D] one's just b[A7sus4]arely getting by but
[Bm]   These people r[G]aised me and I-I-I,[D] can't w[A7sus4]ait to go home

Chorus 3:
  And [D]I'm on [D/F#]my   [G]way, [Bm]I still re[A7sus4]member
  These [D]old coun[D/F#]try  [G]lanes when [Bm]we did not [A7sus4]know the answers
  And [D]I miss [D/F#]the  [G]way you make[Bm]  me feel[A7sus4]and it's real
  [D]We watched [D/F#]the s[G]unset [Bm]over the c[A7sus4]astle on the hill
  [D]   [D/F#]     [G]    [Bm]Over the c[A7sus4]astle on the hill
  [D]   [D/F#]     [G]    [Bm]Over the c[A7sus4]astle on the hill[D]
