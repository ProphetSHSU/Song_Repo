Intro:
[G][D][Em][C][D][G]

We are [G]dead to rights born and raised
We are thick and thin 'til our last day
So [Em]hold me close and I'll su[C]rrender to your [G]heart
You know how to give and how to take
You see every hope I locked away
So [Em]pull me close and sur[C]render to my [G]heart

Before the [Em*]flame goes[D*] ou[G*]t tonight
Yeah, we'll [C*]live un[G*]til we [D*]die

So [Em]come out, come out, come [C]out
Won't you turn my [G]soul, into a [D]raging fire?
[Em]Come out, come out, come [C]out
'Til we lose con[G]trol, into a [D]raging f[Em]i--[C]-i[G]re
Into a [D]raging fire
[Em]Come out, come out, come [C]out
Won't you turn my [G]soul[D-][once/mute]
Into a raging [G]fi[D]re[Em]?[C]

[G]You know time will give and time will take
All the memories made will wash away
Even [Em]though we've changed, [C]I'm still here with [G]you
If you listen close, you'll hear the sound
Of all the ghosts that bring us do-[Em]own
Hold [C]on to what makes you [G]feel
Don't let go, it's what makes you real

If the[Em*] flame goes[D*] ou[G*]t tonight
Yeah, we'll [C*]live un[G*]til we [D*]die

So [Em]come out, come out, come [C]out
Won't you turn my [G]soul, into a [D]raging fire?
[Em]Come out, come out, come [C]out
'Til we lose con[G]trol, into a [D]raging f[Em]i--[C]-i[G]re
Into a [D]raging fire
[Em]Come out, come out, come [C]out
Won't you turn my [G]soul[D]
Into a raging fire?[G][D][Em][C]

Let the[Em*] world leave[D*] us [G*]behind,
Let your [C*]heart be [G]next to [D*]mine
Before the [Em*]flame goes[D*] ou[G*]t tonight
We can [C*]live un[G*]til we [D*]die

[Em][C][G][D]

[Em]Come out, come out, come [C]out
Won't you turn my [G]soul, into a [D]raging f[-stop]ire?

So [Em]come out, come out, come [C]out
Won't you turn my [G]soul, into a [D]raging fire?
[Em]Come out, come out, come [C]out
'Til we lose con[G]trol, into a [D]raging f[Em]i--[C]-i[G]re
Into a [D]raging f[Em]i--[C]-i[G]re[G]
