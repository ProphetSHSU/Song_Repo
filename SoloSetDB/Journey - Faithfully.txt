Verse:
Highway r[G]un
Into the m[Em]idnight sun
[C]Wheels go round and round
You're on my m[G]ind
Restless h[G]earts
Sleep al[Em]one tonight
[C]Sending all my love
Along the [G]wi[D]re

Chorus 1:
[C]They say that the road
Ain't no place to start a f[Em]ami[G]ly
[C]Right down the l[Em]ine
It's been you and [G]me
And lovi[C]n' a music man
Ain't always what it's sup[Em]posed to [G]be
[D]Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm fo[Am]rever yours[C]
F[G]aithfully

Verse:
Circus l[G]ife
Under the [Em]big top world
[C]We all need the clowns
To make us sm[G]ile
Through space and t[G]ime
Always an[Em]other show
[C]Wondering where I am
Lost with[G]out y[D]ou

Chorus 2:
[C]And being apart
Ain't easy on this l[Em]ove a[G]ffair
[C]Two strangers learn to fall in l[Em]ove a[G]gain
[C]I get the joy of rediscove[Em]ring you[G]
[D]Oh, girl, you stand by me
I'm f[Am]orever y[C]ours
[G]Faithfully
