[C][F][Am][F]

[C][F][Am][F]

I'm always [C]running scared through an [F]endless night.
The moon is just a [Am]memory, her and her [F]fabled light.
But when I [C]close my eyes sometimes I [F]dare to dream,
But I'm sure nobody [Am]cares for me, no one's [F]there with me
In the [C]darkness,[F] in the [Am]darkness[F]

Sometimes I'll [C]howl a tune to hear it [F]echo back,
Then clutch it like [Am]some ancient rune to [F]ward off the black.
But when the [C]wolves join in I [F]hold my breath and shake,
'Cause I'm sure nobody [Am]cares for me, no one's [F]there with me
In the [C]darkness,[F] in the [Am]darkness[F](x2)

But now I'm [G]standing here beneath that great abyss,
Staring up I feel my [F]legs give way, I feel a ghostly kiss.
I [G]hear the hidden stars sing out the one true myth,
Their singing that you [F]care for me, and you're there with me
in the [C]darkness.

But I'm [F]always running scared in the [Am]darkness
Could it [F]be you're really there in the [C]darkness?
It's more than [F]I could ever dare to dream,
That you would [Am]care for me,
That you're [F]there with me
in the [C]darkness,[F] in the [Am]darkness[F]
in the [C]darkness[F]
Do you [Am]care for me?
Are you [F]there in the [F]darkness?
