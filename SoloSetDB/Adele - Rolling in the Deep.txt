Intro:
[Am]

Verse:
[Am]There's a fire [Em]starting in my heart,
[G]Reaching a fever pitch, and it's [Em]bringing me out the dark[G]
[Am]Finally, I can [Em]see you crystal clear
[G]Go ahead and sell me out, and I[Em]'ll lay your shit bare[G]

[Am]See how I'll leave with [Em]every piece of you
[G]Don't underestimate the [Em]things that I will do[G]
[Am]There's a fire [Em]starting in my heart
[G]Reaching a fever pitch, and it's [Em]bringing me out the dark[G]

Pre-Chorus:
[F]   The scars of [G]your love, remind me [Em]of us
They keep me [F]thinking that we almost had [G]it [F]all
The scars of [G]your love, they leave me [Em]breathless
I can't help [E7#5]feeling...

Chorus:
We could have had it [Am]all... (You're gonna wish you, [G]never had met me)...
Rolling in the [F]deep (Tears are gonna fall, [F]rolling in the [G]deep)
    (G)                                          Am            G
You had my heart... (you're gonna wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
And you pla[F]yed it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the b[F]eat (Rolling in the [G]deep)

Verse:
[Am]Baby, I have no [Em]story to be told,
But [G]I've heard one on you. Now I'm [Em]gonna make your head burn[G]
[Am]Think of me in the [Em]depths of your despair

[G]Make a home down there, as [Em]mine sure won't be shared[G]

Pre-Chorus:
[F]   The scars of [G]your love, remind me [Em]of us. (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
They keep me [F]thinking that we almost had it [F]all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of [G]your love, they leave me [Em]breathless (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
I can't help [E7]feeling... (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Chorus:
We could have had it [Am]all...  (You're gonna wish you, [G]never had met me)...
Rolling in the [F]deep (Tears are gonna fall, [F]rolling in the [G]deep)
    (G)                                          Am            G
You had my heart... (you're gonna wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
And you pla[F]yed it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the b[F]eat (Rolling in the [G]deep)

Interlude:

(G)               F     G
Could have had it all
Rolling in the [Am]deep[G]
You had my heart in[F]side of your h[F]and
But you pla[G]yed it    with a be[G]ating

Verse:
N.C.
Throw yourself through every open door (Whoa)

Count your blessings to find what you look for (Whoa-uh)
[Am]Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Whoa)

You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow.

Chorus:
([Am]You're gonna wish you, [G]never had met me)
We could have had it [F]all (Tears are gonna fall, [F]rolling in the [G]deep)
   (G)               Am                               G
We could have had it all yeah (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
It [F]all,   It all,   It [F]all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the [G]deep)

   (G)               Am                          G
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
Rolling in the [F]deep (Tears are gonna fall, [F]rolling in the [G]deep)
    (G)                                    Am            G
You had my heart (you're gonna wish you) Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
And you pla[F]yed it (Tears are gonna fall) To the b[F]eat (Rolling in the [G]deep)

   (G)               Am                          G
We could have had it all (You're gonna wish you, never had met me)
Rolling in the [F]deep (Tears are gonna fall, [F]rolling in the [G]deep)
    (G)                                    Am            G
You had my heart (you're gonna wish you) Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
But you pla[F]yed it. You played it. You pla[F]yed it.
You pla[G]yed it to the [Am]beat.
