Verse 1:
[A]We can dance if we want to
We can [G]leave your friends [D]behind
Cause your friends don't dance and [G]if they don't dance
Well they're [A]no friends of [E]mine
I say, [A]we can go where we want to
A [G/F#]place where they will never [D]find
And we can act like we come from [G]out of this world
Leave the [A]real one far be[E]hind
And we can [D]dance, and [G]sing[C][F]

Verse 2:
[A]We can go when we want to
The night is [G]young and so am [D]I
And we can dress real neat from our [G]hats to our feet
And su[A]rprise 'em with the victory [E]cry
Say, [A]we can act if want to
If we [G/F#]don't nobody [D]will
And you can act real rude and [G]totally removed
And I can [A]act like an imbe[E]cile

Verse 3:
[A]We can dance if we want to
We've got [G]all your life and [D]mine
As long as we abuse it, [G]never gonna lose it
