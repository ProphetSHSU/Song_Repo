[Verse 1]

Just where it know lies I can no longer say
I found it on a cold and November day
In the roots of a sycamore tree where it had hid so long
In a box made out of myrtle lay the bone of song

[Verse 2]

The bone of song was a jawbone old and bruised
and worn out in the service of the muse
and along its sides and teeth were written words
I ran my palm along them and I heard

[Chorus 1]

 C         G       D              C              G D C C
Lucky are you who finds me in the wilderness
 G/A           G         G/F#            G/F#       
I am the only unquiet ghost that does not seek rest

[Verse 3]

the words on the bone of song were close and small
and though their tongues were dead I found I knew them all
in the hieroglyphs of quills and quatrain lines
Osiris, the fall of Troy, Auld Lang Syne

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 4]

then I saw on a white space that was left
a blessing written older than the rest
it said leave me here I care not for wealth or fame
I'll remember your song, but I'll forget your name

[Chorus 3]

the words that I sang blew off like the leaves in the wind
and perched like birds in the branches before landing on the bone again

[Verse 5]

then the bone was quiet it said no more to me
so I wrapped it in the ribbons of a sycamore tree
and as night had come I turned around and headed home
with a lightness in my step and a song in my bones

[Chorus 1]

lucky are you who finds me in the wilderness
I am the only unquiet ghost that does not seek rest

[Outro]
