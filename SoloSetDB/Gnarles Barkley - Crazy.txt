Verse:
[Cm]I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my m[D#maj7]ind
There was something so pleasant about that pl[G#]ace.
Even your emotions had an echo
In so much spac[Gsus]e[G]
[Cm]And when you're out there, without care,
Yeah, I was out of to[D#maj7]uch
But it wasn't because I didn't know eno[G#]ugh
I just knew too much[Gsus][G]

Chorus:
[Cm]Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me [D#]crazy??
Does that make me [G#]crazy???
Possibly.[Gsus][G]

Verse:
[C]And I hope that you are having the time of your l[G#]ife
But think tw[D#maj7]ice, that's my only advice[Gsus][G]
[Cm]Come on now, who do you, who do you, who do you, who do you think you a[D#]re,
Ha ha ha bless your so[G#]ul
You really think you're in co[Gsus]ntrol[G]

Chorus:
[Cm]Well, I think you're crazy!
I think you're cra[D#maj7]zy!
I think you're cra[G#]zy,
Just like me.[Gsus][G]

Verse:
[C]My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out o[G#]n a limb
And all I re[D#maj7]member is thinking, I want[Gsus] to be [G]like them
[Cm]Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun[D#]
And it's no coincidenc[G#]e I've come
And I can die when I'm done[Gsus][G]

Chorus:
[Cm]Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're [D#maj7]crazy
Maybe we're [G#]crazy
Probably[Gsus][G]
