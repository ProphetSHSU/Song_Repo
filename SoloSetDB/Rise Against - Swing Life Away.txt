Verse 1:
Am I loud and [E5]clear, 
or am[G5] I  breaking u[C5]p?
Am I still your [E5]charm, 
or am[G5] I  just b[C5]ad  luck?
Are [E5]we getting[G5] closer, 
or ar[C5]e we just getting mo[D5/A]re lost?
I'll show you [E5]mine 
if you[G5] show me your[C5]s first
Let's compare [E5]scars, 
I'll[G5] tell you who[C5]se  is worse
Let's [E5]unwrite these[G5] pages and 
[C5]replace them with our o[D5/A]wn words

Chorus:
We [Em]live on front[Csus2] porches 
and[G] swing life[D5/A] away,
We [Em]get by just[Csus2] fine here 
on[G] minimu[D5/A]m wage
If [Em]love is a[Csus2] labor 
I'll[G] slave till th[D5/A]e end,

I've been here so [E5]long, 
I think that[G5] it's time to mo[C5]ve
The winter's so [E5]cold, 
summer's[G5] over t[C5]oo  soon
[E5]Let's pack our[G5] bags an[C5]d
settle down where palm tre[D5/A]es grow
I've got some [E5]friends, 
some that[G5] I  hardly kn[C5]ow
But we've had some [E5]times, 
I wouldn't[G5] trade for the wor[C5]ld
We chase these [E5]days down with talk[G5]s  
o[C5]f the places that w[D5/A]e will  go

We [Em]live on front[Csus2] porches 
and[G] swing life[D5/A] away,

If [Em]love is a[Csus2] labor 
I'll[G] slave till th[D5/A]e end,
I [Em]won't cross these[Csus2] streets 
until[D5/A] you   hold my hand
Until you hold my hand
