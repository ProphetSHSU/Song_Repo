[G] [Dsus4/F#][Cadd9][Em7][Dsus4/A][Cadd9]

And [G]even though the [Dsus4/F#]moment passed me [Cadd9]by
I [Em7]still can't [Dsus4/A]turn      a[Cadd9]way[(Hold)]
Cause [G]all the dreams you [Dsus4/F#]never thought you'd [Cadd9]lose
Got [Em7]tossed a[Dsus4/A]long the   [Cadd9]way[(Hold)]
And [G]letters that you [Dsus4/F#]never meant to [Cadd9]send
Get [Em7]lost or [Dsus4/A]thrown    a[Cadd9]way[(Hold)]

And [Em7]now we're grown up [Dsus4/A]orphans
That [Cadd9]never knew their names
We [Em7]don't belong to [Dsus4/A]no one
That's a s[Cadd9]hame
But [Em7]you could hide be[Dsus4/A]side me
[Cadd9]Maybe for a while
And [Em7]I won't tell [Dsus4/A]no one your [Cadd9]name
And I won't tell em your [G]name [Dsus4/F#][Cadd9][Em7][Dsus4/A][Cadd9]

[G]Scars are souve[Dsus4/F#]nirs you never lose[Cadd9]
The [Em7]past is [Dsus4/A]never      [Cadd9]far [(Hold)]
[G]Did you lose your[Dsus4/F#]self somewhere out [Cadd9]there
Did you [Em7]get to [Dsus4/A]be  a      [Cadd9]star [(Hold)]
And [G]don't it make you [Dsus4/F#]sad to know that [Cadd9]life
Is [Em7]more than [Dsus4/A]who we     [Cadd9]are [(Hold)]

You [Em7]grew up way too [Dsus4/A]fast
And now there's [Cadd9]nothing to believe
And [Em7]reruns all be[Dsus4/A]come our histor[Cadd9]y
A [Em7]tired song keeps [Dsus4/A]playing on a [Cadd9]tired radio
And [Em7]I won't tell [Dsus4/A]no one your [Cadd9]name
And I won't tell em your [G]name[Dsus4/F#][Cadd9]
And [Em7]I won't [Dsus4/A]tell em your [Cadd9]name[(Hold)]
[G]Oooooh  [Dsus4/F#]    mmmm    [Cadd9]mmmm
And [Em7]I won't [Dsus4/A]tell em your [Cadd9]name[(Hold)]

Instrumental :  
[Em7] [Dsus4/A][Cadd9]

[G]  I think about[Dsus4/F#] you all the [Cadd9]time
But [Em7]I don't [Dsus4/A]need the   [Cadd9]same [(Hold)]
It's [G]lonely where you [Dsus4/F#]are come back [Cadd9]down
And [Em7]I won't [Dsus4/A]tell em your [Cadd9]name[Dsus4/A][G]
