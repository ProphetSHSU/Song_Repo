Intro:  

[D] [G][A]

Verse 1:

[D]I ain't had [G]nothin to drink
[A]I knew thats probably [D]what you'd think
[G]If I dropped [A]by this time of [D]night
[D]Remember [G]way back when
I [A]promised you I[D]'d drop in
[G]At one of those [A]meeting down at the [D]Y
Well, [G]they started talkin '[A]bout steps you take
[D]Mistakes you make the hearts you break
And the [G]price you pay
I almost [A]walked away
You could [G]hear a pen drop [A]when this old man
[D]Stood up and said I'm gonna say it again
Like I [G]do every week
For those who [A]don't know me

Chorus:
[D]Its the simple [G]things in life
Like the [A]kids at home and a [D]loving wife
That you [G]miss the most, when you [A]lose control
And every[G]thing you love starts to [A]disappear
[D]The devil takes your hand and say say no fear
Have anoth[G]er shot, [A]just one more beer
Yeah, I've been [G]there,    [A]      thats why I'm [D]here[G][A]

Verse 2:

[D]This ole boy stood [G]up in the aisle
[A]Said he'd been[D]livin a life of denial
And he [G]cried as he [A]talked about the wasted [D]years
[D]I couldn't be[G]lieve what i heard
[A]It was my life [D]word for word
[G]And all of a sudden [A]it was clear

Chorus:
[D]Its the simple [G]things in life
Like the [A]kids at home and a [D]loving wife
That you [G]miss the most, when you [A]lose control
And every[G]thing you love starts to [A]disappear
[D]The devil takes your hand and say say no fear

Have anoth[G]er shot, [A]just one more beer
Yeah, I've been [G]there,    [A]      thats why I'm [D]here

Bridge:
I know for [G]us it may be too [A]late
But it would [G]mean the world to me
If you were [A]there when I stand to say

Chorus:
[D]Its the simple [G]things in life
Like the [A]kids at home and a [D]loving wife
That you [G]miss the most, when you [A]lose control
And every[G]thing you love starts to [A]disappear
[D]The devil takes your hand and say say no fear
Have anoth[G]er shot, [A]just one more beer
Yeah, I've been [G]there,    [A]      thats why I'm [D]here
Oh, I've been ther[G]e,    [A]    that's why I'm h[D]ere[G][A][D]
