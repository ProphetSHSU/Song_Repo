It's that f[C]eeling, that so[C]meone
Is s[Am]tanding,  b[G]ehind me
And [F]I turn    [C]around and there's [G]no one  there[G]
And     i[C]t's the,  sen  s[C]ation
That    [Am]someone,  just  wh[G]ispered
Yeah and   [F]I still hear your  v[C]oice but you're not    r[G]eally  here[G]
Your    me[Dm]mory is like a   gh[Em]ost
And     [F]my heart is it's   h[G]ost

[CHORUS:]F                           G
I can   still feel you,  just as   close as skin
Every   n[C]ow and then
All     b[F]y myself, in a    c[G]rowded room, on my     e[Am]mpty bed
There's a  p[Dm]lace you've touched
[Em]With your love, [Am]no one gets close [F]to

[C][Dm][F][C]

[Am][G]

[F][C][G]

I can still feel you, I can still feel you, I can still feel you, I can
still feel you

[Dm][F][C][Dm][F][C]

Oh, I can still feel you, y-e-a-h

You said you'd  l[C]ove, me for    e[C]ver
Then    y[Am]ou said,  it's    o[G]ver
And     l[F]eft me with[C]out the   m[G]issing    link[G]
I  [C]thought I'd,  for[C]get you
But     I [Am]guess I,  for [G]got to
And     l[F]ately I've     [C]been too con    [G]fused to   t[G]hink
When I  r[Dm]each for someone  [Em]new
It's    l[F]ike I'm touching  y[G]ou

[C][C][Am][G]

[F][C][G]

In [Dm]everything that    m[Em]oves
In [F]everything I    [G]do
