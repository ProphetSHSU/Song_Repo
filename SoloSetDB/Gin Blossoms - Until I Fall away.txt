Intro:
[Asus2] [E] [Bsus4] [C#m]
[Asus2] [E]
[Bsus4]

Verse 1:
[C#m]   I [C#m]want to tell[Asus2]     if I [E]am or I am not myself[Bsus4]
It's [C#m]hard to know[Asus2]     how far[E] or if at all could go[Bsus4]
I've waited [C#m]far too long[Asus2]     for [E]something I forgot was wrong[Bsus4]

Pre-Chorus:
I don't know[Asus2]     all the answers [Bsus4]I    think that I'll find
Or [E]have it within the time,[Asus2]     but it's all that I'll have in mind[Bsus4]

Chorus:
Un[C#m]til I fall away[Asus2]
I [E]won't keep you waiting long[Bsus4]
Un[C#m]til I fall away[Asus2]
I don't [E]know what to do any[Bsus4]more
Un[C#m]til I fall away[Asus2][E]

Verse 2:
[Bsus4]     My [C#m]fear pretend[Asus2]     that I'll [E]never be in love again[Bsus4]
It's [C#m]real to me,[Asus2]     but not[E] like these fools and not[Bsus4]     like this scene
I [C#m]won't find[Asus2]     or [E]have it within the time[Bsus4]

Pre-Chorus:
If it's all [Asus2]rusted and faded in the [Bsus4]spot where we fell
[E]Where I thought I'd left be[Asus2]hind, it's loose now, but we could try[Bsus4]

Chorus:
Un[C#m]til I fall away[Asus2]
I [E]won't keep you waiting long[Bsus4]
Un[C#m]til I fall away[Asus2]
I don't [E]know what to do any[Bsus4]more
Un[C#m]til I fall away[Asus2][E][Bsus4]

Bridge:
[F#5]    [A5]  When there's no good answers
[E5]   [B5]  And no new questions[F#5][A5]
Another personal disaster
[Bsus4]     There's nowhere to go but down[C#m]

Solo:
[Asus2] [E] [Bsus4] [C#m]
[Asus2] [E]

Chorus:
[Bsus4]     Un[C#m]til I fall away[Asus2]
I [E]won't keep you waiting long[Bsus4]
Un[C#m]til I fall away[Asus2]
I don't [E]know what to do any[Bsus4]more
Un[C#m]til I fall away[Asus2][E]

Outro:
[Bsus4]     Un[C#m]til I fall away[Asus2][E]
Un[Bsus4]til  I fall away[C#m]
Un[Asus2]til  I fall away[E]
[Bsus4]     Un[C#m]til I fall away[Asus2]
[E] [Bsus4] [F#5] [A5]
