Intro:
[C][Fmaj7][C]

Verse:
[C/G]Summer time and the wind is blowing, outside in Lower [Am7]Chelsea.
And I don't know what I'm doing in this city,
The sun is always in [G6]my eyes,
It crashes through the [Fmaj7]windows, and I'm sleeping on the couch,
When I came to visit [C]you,
That's when I knew that I could never[Am7]have you,
I knew that before[G6]you did,
Still I'm the one whos[Fmaj7]stupid

Hook:
And there's this [C]burning, like there's[Am7]always been,
I've[G6] never been so alone, and[Fmaj7]I've never been so alive.

Verse:
[C]Visions of you on a motorcycle drive by,
The [A7sus]cigarette ash flies in your eyes, And you don't mind, you [G6]smile,
[Fmaj7]And say the world, it doesn't [C]fit with you.
I don't believe you, you are so serene.
Ca[Am7]reening through the universe, your axis on [G6sus]a tilt,
you're guiltless and [Fmaj7]free,
I hope you take a piece of [C]me with you,
And there's things I would like to do, that you don't bel[Am7]ieve in,
I would like to [G6sus]build something, but you never see it [Fmaj7]happen,

Hook:
And there's this [C]burning, like there's [A7sus]always been,
I've [G6]never been so alone, And [Fmaj7]I've,
[C/G]I've never been so alive,

[Amaj7][G6sus][F]

and there's this [Am7]burnin', uh huh, there is thi[F]s burning,

Verse:
yeah, yeah, yeah.[C/G]..
Where's the soul? I want to know, New York City is evil.
The surface is everything, but I could never [Am7]do that,
Someone would see [G6sus]through that.
And this is the [C/G]last time, we'll be [Am7]friends again.
and [G6sus]I'll get over you, you'll wonder, [F]Who I am.

Hook:
And there's this [C/G]burning, just like there's [Am7]always been,
I've [G6sus]never been so alone, alone, And [F]I've, and I've, I've never been so

a[C]live.......................so a[Fmaj7]live.

Outro:
[C]I go home to the coast. It starts to rain,
I paddle out, [Am7]on the water, alone,  taste the salt and taste the pain.
I'm not [G6sus]thinking of you again,[C]summer dies and swells rise,
The sun goes down in [Am7]my eyes, see this rolling wave,
Darkly comi[G6sus]ng to take me,
[Fmaj7]Home, and I've [G6sus]never been so alone, and [Fmaj7]I've never been so alive.
