[C]You and I could[G]run away
And [D]find a place I'll [G]hide someday
But I [C]wouldn't blame you [G]if you wanted more[D]

[C]So let's pretend it's just [G]you and me here
The [D]town we're in can [G]disappear
We'll [C]grab the sheets and [G]build ourselves a [D]fort

and we'll [C]watch the rain [D]fall and [G]sit up [G/F]on a ro[Em]of
cause it's a [C]perfect night to [D]be here in our [G]youth!

The [C]stress has got the [G]best of me
A [D]party's all I [G]really need
Let's [C]make the calls and [G]meet at someone's [D]pad

The [G]friends are good the [C]booze is too
I'll [D]finally sit and [G]talk to you
and find [C]all the things in [G]common that we [D]had

[C]Tomorrow we'll talk [D]about the things we [G]wish we [G/F]didn't [Em]do
But it's a [C]perfect night to [D]be here in our [G]youth!

And I've [D]heard
There will come a [G]time in our [Em]lives
When our [D]worth is measured in [Em]gold [D]and [C]dime[<-?]s

But when [C]young is just [D]another word
For [G]reckless [G/F]and amu[Em]sed
It's a [C]perfect night to [D]be here in our [G]youth!

So [C]raise your cup, let's [G]not regret
The [D]things we never [G]did or said
It's [C]strange to think that it [G]won't be this for [D]long!

So [C]make a toast, don't [G]brag or boast
No [D]decency is [G]for the old
We're [C]learning what is [G]right and that we're [D]wrong

And we'll [C]measure our [D]success
By the [G]bottles [D]we go [C]through
Cause it's a [C]perfect night to [D]be here in our [G]youth!
It's a [C]perfect night to [D]be here in our [G]youth!
It's a [C]perfect night to [D]be here in our [G]youth!
