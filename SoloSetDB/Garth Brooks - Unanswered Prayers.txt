Intro:
[Em] [D/F#][G][A]

Verse:
[D]Just the other [D/F#]night at a h[G]ometown football game
My [D]wife and[A/C#] I ran i[Bm]nto[A] m[Em]y old high school f[A]lame
And [G]as I introd[F#m]uced them the p[Bm]ast came ba[A]ck to m[G]e
And I [Em]couldn't help but [D/F#]think of the w[G]ay things used to b[A]e

[D]She was the[D/F#] one that I'd [G]wanted for all times
And [D]each night [A/C#]I'd spend p[Bm]rayin[A]' that G[Em]od would make her m[A]ine
And [G]if he'd only g[F#m]rant me this w[Bm]ish I wis[A]hed back th[G]en[F#m]
I'd [Em]never ask for [D/F#]anything a[A]gain

Chorus:
Sometimes I thank [D]Go[D/F#]d for una[G]nswered prayer[A]s
Reme[D]mber[A/C#] when you're ta[Bm]lkin[A]' to the[Em] man upst[A]airs
That just be[D]cause he doesn't [D7/F#]answer doesn't me[G]an he don't ca[E7]re
Some of [D]God's greatest [Bm]gifts a[Em]re unanswer[A]ed prayers[D][F#m][G][A]

Verse:
[D]She wasn't quite the a[D/F#]ngel that I remem[G]bered in my dreams
And I could [D]tell that [A/C#]time had c[Bm]hanged me[A]
In [Em]her eyes too it [A]seemed
We tried to [G]talk about the o[F#m]ld days
There wasn't [Bm]much we co[A]uld rec[G]all[F#m]
I guess the [Em]Lord knows what he's [D/F#]doin' after [A]all

Bridge:
And [G]as she walked away I [F#m]looked at my w[Bm]ife
And then and [Em]there I thanked the [D/F#]good Lord
For the [G]gifts in my [A]life

Chorus:
Sometimes I thank [D]Go[D/F#]d for una[G]nswered prayer[A]s
Reme[D]mber[A/C#] when you're ta[Bm]lkin[A]' to the[Em] man upst[A]airs
That just be[D]cause he doesn't [D7/F#]answer doesn't me[G]an he don't ca[E7]re
Some of [D]God's greatest [Bm]gifts a[Em]re unanswer[A]ed prayers
Some of [D]God's greatest [Bm]gifts are all too [Em]often unansw[A]ered...
Some of [D]God's greatest [Bm]gifts[Em] are unanswe[A]red prayers[D][F#m][G][A][D]
