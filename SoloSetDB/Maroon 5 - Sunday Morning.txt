[Dm7][G][C]

Verse:
[Dm7]   Sunday morn[G]ing rain is fa[C]lling
[Dm7]   Steal some co[G]vers share so[C]me skin
[Dm7]   Clouds are [G]shrouding us in m[C]oments unforgettable
   You [Dm7]twist to fit the m[G]old that I am[C]in
   But t[Dm7]hings just get so cr[G]azy living li[C]fe gets hard to do
   And I would [Dm7]gladly hit the [G]road get up and [C]go if I knew
   That [Dm7]someday it would l[G]ead me back to [C]you
   That [Dm7]someday it would l[G]ead me back to [C]you

Chorus:
[Dm7]That[G] may[C]be all I   need
In darkness she is [Dm7]all [G]I   [C]see
Come and rest your [Dm7]bones w[G]ith  [C]me
Driving slow on Sunday [Dm7]morning
And I n[G]ever want to l[C]eave

Verse:
[Dm7]   Fingers t[G]race your every o[C]utline
[Dm7]   Paint a p[G]icture with m[C]y hands
[Dm7]   Back and f[G]orth we sway like [C]branches in a storm
   Change the [Dm7]weather still toge[G]ther when it [C]ends

Chorus:
[Dm7]That[G] may[C]be all I   need
In darkness she is [Dm7]all [G]I   [C]see
Come and rest your [Dm7]bones w[G]ith  [C]me
Driving slow on Sunday [Dm7]morning
And I [G]never want to [C]leave

Bridge:
[Dm7]But things just get [G]so crazy livi[C]ng life gets hard to do
And I would [Dm7]gladly hit the [G]road get up and [C]go if I knew
That [Dm7]someday it would l[G]ead me back to [C]you
That [Dm7]someday it would l[G]ead me back to [C]you

Chorus:
[Dm7]That[G] may[C]be all I   need
In darkness she is [Dm7]all [G]I   [C]see
Come and rest your [Dm7]bones w[G]ith  [C]me
Driving slow on Sunday [Dm7]morning
And I [G]never want to [C]leave
