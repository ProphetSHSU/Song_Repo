Intro:
[F]Help me, it's like the [Bb]walls are caving in
Some[Dm]times I feel like giving up
But [Bb]I just can't, it isn't in my [F]blood

Verse:
Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing[Bb]

I'm overwhelmed and insecure
Give me something[Dm]
I could take to ease my mind slowly[Bb]
Just have a drink and you'll feel [F]better
Just take her home and you'll feel [Bb]better
Keep telling me that it gets [Dm]better
Does it [Bb]ever?

Chorus:
[F]Help me, it's like the [Bb]walls are caving in
Some[Dm]times I feel like giving up
No [Bb]medicine is strong enough
Someone [F]help me
I'm [Bb]crawling in my skin
Some[Dm]times I feel like giving up
But [Bb]I just can't, it isn't in my [F]blood[Bb]
It isn't in my [Dm]blood[Bb]

Verse:
[F]Looking through my phone again feeling anxious[Bb]
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this[Dm]
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't [Bb]breathe, oh
Is there somebody that could [F]help me?

Chorus:
It's like the [Bb]walls are caving in
Some[Dm]times I feel like giving up
No [Bb]medicine is strong enough
Someone [F]help me
I'm [Bb]crawling in my skin

Some[Dm]times I feel like giving up
But [Bb]I just can't, it isn't in my [F]blood[Bb]
It isn't in my [Dm]blood[Bb]

Bridge:
I need somebody [F]now
I need somebody [Bb]now
Someone to help me [Dm]out
I need somebody [Bb]now

Outro:
[F]Help me
It's like the [Bb]walls are caving in
Some[Dm]times I feel like giving up
But [Bb]I just can't, it isn't in my [F]blood[Bb]
It isn't in my [Dm]blood[Bb]
It isn't in my [F]blood
I need somebody [Bb]now
It isn't in my [Dm]blood
I need somebody [Bb]now
It isn't in my [F]blood[Bb][Dm][Bb]
