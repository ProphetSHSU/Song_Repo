[Intro]
G    Em7    Cadd9    G  D
 
[Verse 1]
Cadd9
Heartbeats fast
           G
Colors and promises
          Em7
How to be brave
          D              Cadd9
How can I love when I'm afraid to fall
                 G
But watching you stand alone
          Em7            D             Am7
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow
         Em7 D
One step closer
 
[Chorus]
G
I have died every day waiting for you
Em7                               D
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
      Cadd9
For a thousand years
                    D
I'll love you for a thousand more
 
[Verse 2]
Cadd9
Time stands still
          G
Beauty in all she is
          Em7
I will be brave
           D            Cadd9
I will not let anything take away
                   G
What's standing in front of me
      Em7
Every breath
      D                Am7
Every hour has come to this
         Em7 D
One step closer
 
[Chorus]
G
I have died every day waiting for you
Em7                               D
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
      Cadd9
For a thousand years
                    D
I'll love you for a thousand more
 
    G
And all along I believed I would find you
Em7
Time has brought your heart to me
        D              Cadd9
I have loved you for a thousand years
                    D
I'll love you for a thousand more
 
[Instrumental]
G    Em7    Cadd9    D
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am7           Em7 D
     One step closer
Am7           Em7 D
     One step closer
 
[Chorus]
G
I have died every day waiting for you
Em7                               D
Darling, don't be afraid, I have loved you
      Cadd9
For a thousand years
                    D
I'll love you for a thousand more
 
    G
And all along I believed I would find you
Em7
Time has brought your heart to me
        D              Cadd9
I have loved you for a thousand years
                    D
I'll love you for a thousand more
