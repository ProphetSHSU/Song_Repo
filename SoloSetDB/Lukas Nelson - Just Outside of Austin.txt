[C] [C#dim][G7/D][D#+]

Verse:
[C]The cedar trees, the morning air
The [Cmaj7]way the dew sits on her hair
So pe[A#6]acefully below a Texas [A7]sky
I t[Dm]hink I’ll leave her lying there
[DmM7]Take a walk I don’t know where
Just ba[Gsus2]thing in the su[G]nlight in my l[C]ife

Verse:
I h[C]ear the sound of windy leaves
[Cmaj7]Summer birds and gently flowing
R[A#6]ivers creeks and pools up from the s[A7]pring
The m[Dm]usic of the water on the [DmM7]rocks is getting louder
As I w[Gsus2]alk towards wha[G]tever life may b[C]ring

Chorus:
J[C]ust out[Cmaj7]side of Au[Dm]sti[DmM7]n[D7sus2][D6sus2]

I t[Dm]hink I fell in l[G]ove with you a[C]gain[G][G+add5]

Verse:
I went [C]out to play the other day
The c[Cmaj7]ity and it’s city ways
A t[A#6]ime and place for everything you’d [A7]say
But[Dm]I just want to sit at home
R[DmM7]ide my horse or write a song
[Gsus2]A little bit of w[G]eed and I’m o[C]kay

Verse:
Those ni[C]ghts when it’s just you and me
Or m[Cmaj7]aybe soon we could be three
It [A#6]ain’t so bad a place to raise a [A7]kid
Or [Dm]maybe we should wait awhile
No n[DmM7]eed to hurry nothing
I’m just[Gsus2] saying I’d be h[G]appy if we [C]did

Chorus:
J[C]ust out[Cmaj7]side of Au[Dm]sti[DmM7]n[D7sus2][D6sus2]
[Gsus2]High a[G]s I have ever b[C]een[C#dim][G7/D][D#+]
