Verse:
One more [Am]day we'll [F]spend [C]together
Lay your [Am]eyes, look up upon [F]me for the [C]better
Oh, I [Am]know I'm [F]worse for [C]weather
But my [Am]love, I won't [G]give [C]up
Spend my [Am]days cur[F]sing my [C]soul
Wishing [Am]I could paint my scars and [F]make me [C]whole
Oh, I [Am]know I [F]could be [C]better
But my [Am]love, I won't [G]give [C]up

Chorus:
[F]I ain't no Superman, [C]I ain't no Holy Ghost
[G]I'm just the one that keeps you[Am]up at night, you love the most

[G]I'll be the sun, I'll be the[Am]waves, I'll be the one you love the most

I'll be your [Am]West Coast, honey

I'll be, I'll [G]be, I'll be, I'll be,
I'll be your [Am]West Coast, honey

Verse:
I'll change my [Am]ways if [F]you would [C]stay
All your [Am]tears that you have cried [F]will go [C]away
Oh, just [Am]grant me [F]one more [C]day
Oh, my [Am]love, please don't [G]give [C]up
See the [Am]Devil [F]at my [C]door
I see the [Am]future of the ones [F]that I've [C]ignored
I guess I was [Am]born to [F]be at [C]war
But my [Am]love, I won't [G]give [C]up
So, my [Am]love, please don't [G]give [C]up

[G]I'll be the sun, I'll be the [Am]waves, I'll be the one you love the most
