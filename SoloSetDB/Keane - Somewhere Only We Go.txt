[A][C#m][Bm][E]
[A][C#m][Bm][E]

Verse:
[A]I walked across [C#m]an empty land
[Bm]I knew the pathway like the [D]back of my [E]hand
[A]I felt the earth [C#m]beneath my feet
[Bm]Sat by the river, and it [D]made me com[E]plete

Pre-Chorus:
[F#m]Oh, simple thing, [C#m]where have you gone?
[Bm]I'm getting old and I need [D]something to re[E]ly on
[F#m]So tell me when [C#m]you're gonna let me in
[Bm]I'm getting tired and I [D]need somewhere to be[E]gin

Verse:
[A]I came across a [C#m]fallen tree
[Bm]I felt the branches of it [D]looking at [E]me
[A]Is this the place [C#m]we used to love?
[Bm]Is this the place that I've been [D]dreaming [E]of?

Pre-Chorus:
[F#m]Oh, simple thing, [C#m]where have you gone?
[Bm]I'm getting old and I need [D]something to re[E]ly on
[F#m]So tell me when [C#m]you're gonna let me in
I[Bm]'m getting tired and I need [D]somewhere to be[E]gin

Chorus:
[D]And if you have a [A]minute, why don't [F#m]we g[E]o
[D]Talk about it [A]somewhere only [F#m]we k[E]now?
[D]This could be the [A]end of every[F#m]thing
[Bm]So why don't we go
[C#m]Somewhere only we know?
[C#m]Somewhere only we know? (pause)

Pre-Chorus:
[F#m]Oh, simple thing, [C#m]where have you gone?
[Bm]I'm getting old and I need [D]something to re[E]ly on
[F#m]So tell me when [C#m]you're gonna let me in
[Bm]I'm getting tired and I need [D]somewhere to be[E]gin

Chorus:
[D]And if you have a [A]minute, why don't [F#m]we g[E]o
[D]Talk about it [A]somewhere only [F#m]we k[E]now?
[D]This could be the [A]end of every[F#m]thing
[Bm]So why don't we go?
[C#m]So why don't we go?
