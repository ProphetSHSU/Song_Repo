Intro:
[G]

Verse:
[G]In the night while my[Cadd9] body sl[G]ept in my bed
[G]my mind was running through the [Cadd9]woods ins[G]tead
One h[Cadd9]undred miles an hour in the fast lane
One hundred miles an hour in my h[G]ead.

[G]Vagabond dreamin takes me th[Cadd9]rough the n[G]ight
sippin whiskey by the river living [Cadd9]out of s[G]ight
One h[Cadd9]undred miles an hour in the fast lane
One hundred miles an hour toward the l[G]ight

See the curve in that r[Cadd9]iver's b[G]end
I look at you and I [Cadd9]see my fr[G]iend
[Cadd9]One hundred miles an hour in the fast lane
One hundred miles an hour till the e[G]nd

Instrumental:
[G][Cadd9][G]

[G][Cadd9][G]

Outro:
[G]My heart does beat like a Ch[Cadd9]erokee d[G]rum
and in the morning when that [Cadd9]sun does c[G]ome
[Cadd9]One hundred miles an hour in the fast lane
[Cadd9]One hundred miles an hour in the fast lane
One hundred miles an hour till I'm d[G]one.
