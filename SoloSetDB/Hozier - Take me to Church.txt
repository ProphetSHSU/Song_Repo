Intro:
[Em]My lover's got [Am]humour[Em]
She's the giggle at a f[Am]uneral[G]
Knows everybody's disap[Am]proval[Em]
I should've worshipped her s[Am]ooner[Em]
If the Heavens ever d[Am]id spea[Em]k
She is the last true [Am]mouth pi[G]ece
Every Sunday's getting m[Am]ore blea[Em]k
A fresh poison e[Am]ach we[D]ek
'We were born sick,[C] you heard them say it[Em]
My church offers no ab[Am]solute[Em]s
She tells me 'worship in the [Am]bedroo[G]m'
The only heaven I'll be s[Am]ent t[Em]o
Is when I'm alone w[Am]ith y[D]ou
I was born sick[C], but I love it

Command me to be well
[G]Aaaaaaa[C]aa    [G]aaaaaaaa[C]amen.[G] Aaaaaa[Cm]aam[G]en. [G/F#]Amen[F#][F]

Chorus:
Take me to chu[Em]rch
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your l[B7]ies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your k[G]nife
Offer me that dea[Am]thless death
Good [Em]God, let me give you my l[Am]ife[G][G][F#]

Take me to chu[Em]rch
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your l[B7]ies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your k[G]nife
Offer me that dea[Am]thless death
Good [Em]God, let me give you my l[Am]ife[G][G][F#]

Verse:
[Em]If I'm a pagan of the g[Am]ood times
[Em]My lover's the sun[Am]light
[G]To keep the Goddess o[Am]n my side
[Em]She demands a sac[Am]rifice
[D]To drain the whole sea
[C]Get something shiny
[Em]Something meaty for the [Am]main course[Em]
That's a fine looking h[Am]igh horse[G]
What you got in the [Am]stable?[Em]
We've a lot of starving f[Am]aithful
[D]That looks tasty
[C]That looks plenty
[C]This is hungry work
[G][F#][Em]

Chorus:
Take me to chu[Em]rch
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your l[B7]ies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your k[G]nife
Offer me that dea[Am]thless death
Good [Em]God, let me give you my l[Am]ife[G][G][F#]

Take me to chu[Em]rch
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your l[B7]ies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your k[G]nife
Offer me that dea[Am]thless death
Good [Em]God, let me give you my l[Am]ife[G][G][F#]

Bridge:
[C]No masters or[G] kings when the r[B7]itual begins[Em]
There is[C] no sweeter i[G]nnocence than [B7]our gentle si[Em]n
In the m[C]adness and so[G]il of that [B7]sad earthly s[Em]cene
Only [C]then I am h[G]uman
[B7]Only then I a[Em]m clean[D][C]
[G]Amen. A[C]men. A[G]men[Cm][G][Cm][G][G][F#][F]

Chorus:
Take me to chu[Em]rch

Offer me that dea[Am]thless death
Good [Em]God, let me give you my l[Am]ife[G][G][F#]

Take me to chu[Em]rch
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your l[B7]ies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your k[G]nife
