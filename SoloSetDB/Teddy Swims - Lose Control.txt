Verse:
[F#m]Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I [A]don't know myself anymore
[D]Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the [C#sus4]devil's knockin' at my [C#]door, woah
[F#m]Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm [A]no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's [D]taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From [C#sus4]tearin' the skin off my [C#]bones, don't you know

Chorus:
[F#m]   I lose con[A]trol
When you're not [D]next to me
I'm [C#sus4]fallin' apart right in [C#]front of you, can't you see?[F#m]
I lose con[A]trol
When you're not [D]next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're [C#sus4]breakin' my heart, baby
[C#]You make a mess of me[F#m]

Verse:
Problematic
Problem is I want your [A]body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to [D]break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my [C#sus4]own
But I want that real full [C#]moon black magic, but it takes two
[F#m]Problematic
Problem is when I'm [A]with you I'm an addict
And I need some re[D]lief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the [C#sus4]trees
Got me down on my [C#]knees, darlin', please, o[F#m]h

Chorus:
I lose con[A]trol
When you're not [D]next to me
I'm [C#sus4]fallin' apart right in [C#]front of you, can't you see?[F#m]
I lose con[A]trol
When you're not [D]next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're [C#sus4]breakin' my heart, baby
[C#]You make a mess of me[F#m]yeah

Chorus:
[F#m]   I lose con[A]trol
When you're not [D]here with me hm
I'm [C#sus4]fallin' apart right in [C#]front of you, can't you see?[F#m]
I lose con[A]trol
When you're not [D]here with me, mhm
Yeah, you're [C#sus4]breakin' my heart, baby
[C#]You make a mess of me[F#m]
