Intro:
[D]

Verse:
[D]Few days before he turned 80
[A]He was sitting out back in a rocker
[G]He said, what you been up to lately

I told him chasing a dollar
[D]And in between sips of coffee
[A]He poured this wisdom out
[G]Said if you want my two cents on making a dollar count

Chorus:
Buy [D]dirt
Find the one you can't live wit[A]hout
Get a ring, let your knee hit the [Bm]ground
Do what you love but call it [G]work
And throw a little money in the plate at ch[D]urch
Send some prayers up and your roots down [A]deep
Add a few limbs to your family [Bm]tree

And watch their pencils marks
And the [G]grass in the yard

All grow up
[D]'Cause the truth about it [A]is

It all goes by real quick

[Bm]You can't buy happ[G]iness
But you can buy [D]dirt

Verse:
[D]Before you get caught on that ladder
[A]Let me tell you what it's all abou[D]t
[G]Find you a few things that matter

That you can put a fence around

And then he laid it out

Chorus:
Buy [D]dirt
Find the one you can't live wit[A]hout
Get a ring, let your knee hit the [Bm]ground
Do what you love but call it [G]work
And throw a little money in the plate at ch[D]urch
Send some prayers up and your roots down [A]deep
Add a few limbs to your family [Bm]tree

And watch their pencils marks
And the [G]grass in the yard

All grow up
[D]'Cause the truth about it [A]is

It all goes by real quick
[Bm]You can't buy happ[G]iness

But you can buy [Bm]dirt[A]
You can buy [G]dirt[D]

Bridge:
[A]And thank the good Lord for it

'Cause He ain't makin' any more of it

Chorus:
Buy [D]dirt
Find the one you can't live wit[A]hout
Get a ring, let your knee hit the [Bm]ground
Do what you love but call it [G]work
And throw a little money in the plate at ch[D]urch
Send some prayers up and your roots down [A]deep
Add a few limbs to your family [Bm]tree

And watch their pencils marks
And the [G]grass in the yard

All grow up
[D]'Cause the truth about it [A]is

It all goes by real quick
[Bm]You can't buy happ[G]iness
But you can buy [D]dirt
