Verse:
[G]  He was[D] named by my grandma, she got it from the [G]bible
And he passed[D]  it onto me, like granddaddy's r[G]ifle
Raised me up[D]  like sweet corn, created a disc[G]iple
Yeah, I [D]fought it like hell, hell he became a r[G]ival

Pre-Chorus:
Yeah, I tried[Em]   to be different Trie[Bm7]d
to go against[G]the grain
Didn't make[Em]   no difference [Bm7]I
just ended up[G]the same

Chorus:

God damn, I am my father's [D]son, yea[A]h

Verse:
[G]  Yeah,[D] I left town just t[A]o get out of his sha[G]dow
And he'd [D]send me a twenty just to[A] get back on that sadd[G]le

[G]  I am my father's[D] s[A]on

Bridge:

I used[Em]   to hate being called[Bm7]Junior
Now [G]I don't mind any longer

Chorus:
[D]  I've never know[A]n  bette[G]r,  yeah
[D]  'Cause every bone'[A]s  tether[G]ed
You wanna [D]change my name, gotta[A] drain my blo[G]od
