intro: 
[A  G]

[A]     At home[G]

Drawing pictures
Of mountain [G]tops
[A]With him on top
Lemon yell[A]ow sun
[G]Arms raised in a V
[G]And the dead [A]lay in pools of maroon below

[A]    Da[G]ddy didn't give attention[G]
[A]Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't [A]care[G]
King Jeremy The Wick[G]ed[A]
[A]Ruled his world

[F]Jeremy spoke in[Dm] cl[E]ass to[A]day
[F]Jeremy spoke in[Dm] cl[E]ass to[A]day

[A]    [G]Clearly I remember
Pickin' on the b[G]oy[A]

Seemed a harmless little fuck
[A]    [G]But we unleashed a lion
[G]Gna[A]shed his teeth

And bit the recess lady's breast
How could I for[A]get[G]
And he hit me with a surprise left[G]
[A]My jaw left hurting
Dropped wide open[A]
[G]Just like the day
Oh, [A]like the day I heard

[A]   D[G]addy didn't give affection, no[G]!
[A]And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't [A]wear[G]
King Jeremy The Wi[G]cked[A]
[A]Ruled his world
[F]Jeremy spoke in[Dm] cl[E]ass to[A]day
[F]Jeremy spoke in[Dm] cl[E]ass to[A]day
[F]Jeremy spoke in[Dm] cl[E]ass to[A]day
[F]Jeremy spoke in[Dm] cl[E]ass to[A]day

Try to forget [F]this
Try to forget [G]this
Try to erase [A]this from the black [F]board[G][A]
