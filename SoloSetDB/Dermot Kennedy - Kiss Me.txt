Intro:
[C][G]
[Am]  You could take a pho[C]to

Verse:
Eternalise this mo[G]ment
For the days[Am]when I don't believe
When our love gets sto[C]len
'Cause there's no excep[G]tion
And I know time[Am]will take you far from me

Pre-Chorus:
Let this night in[C]vade my lungs, you're [G]all I wanna breathe[Am]
[F] Right beside the [C]lake, I burn for [G]you, you burn for me[Am]
[F] So kiss me the wa[C]y that you would[G]

Chorus:
If we die[Am]tonight
[F] Hold me the way[C] that you would[G]
For the fi[Am]nal time
[F] Whatever may come,[C] somewhere deep in[G]side
There's always this ver[Am]sion of you and [F]I
So just kiss me the way[C] that you would[G]
If we die[Am]tonight

Verse:
[F] All the deepest sec[C]rets, all the darkest mo[G]ments
Oh, I pro[Am]mise they'll be safe with me
We've all been bro[C]ken, there's no excep[G]tion
But you car[Am]ry it so gracefully

Pre-Chorus:
Let this night in[C]vade my lungs, you're [G]all I wanna breathe[Am]

[F] So kiss me the wa[C]y that you would[G]

Chorus:
If we die[Am]tonight
[F] Hold me the way[C] that you would[G]
For the fi[Am]nal time, yeah
[F] Whatever may come,[C] somewhere deep in[G]side

Mm mm mm
So kiss me the wa[C]y that you would[G]

If we die[Am]tonight
[F] And hold me the way[C] that you would[G]

Whatever may come,[C] somewhere deep in[G]side
