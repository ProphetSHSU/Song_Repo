Verse:
I [C]love you, I hate it, [F]I can't get [C]through
I've [C]tried to re-name it to a [G]face not you
But [C]it can't be contained and
And it [F]just won't [C]do
What I [C]want so I'll [G]let it out[C]
My [C]body's been aching from [F]times hard [C]weight
And [C]I'm sorry for shaking in [G]your steady grace
But [C]I'll say it if you say it but [F]I won't go [C]first
If [C]you want to leave then [G]walk me out[C]

Chorus:
[F]Let's go get lost on a [C]long back road
[F]Where the river turns to streams and the [C]time moves slow
It's not [Am]anything you [G]say, [F]anywhere we go
It's just [F]being [G]alone with [C]you now
[F]Being [G]alone with [C]you

Verse:
[C]Either death like a shadow or [F]love like a [C]light
[F]Every step it must follow then [G]stay back and fight

For [C]what you laid down or stood [F]for in your life's great [C]breath
We [C]sigh out, but we [G]never die[C]

Chorus:
So [F]let's go get lost on a [C]long back road
Where the [F]river turns to streams and the [C]time moves slow
It's not [Am]anything you [G]say, [F]anywhere we go
It's just [F]being [G]alone with y[C]ou now
[F]Being [G]alone with [C]you, that's right

Bridge:
[F]Let's save our breath

Chorus:
[F]Let's go get lost on a [C]long back road
[F]Where the river turns to streams and the [C]time moves slow
It's not [Am]anything you [G]say, [F]anywhere we go
It's just [F]being [G]alone with [C]you now
[F]Being [G]alone with [C]you now
[F]Being [G]alone
