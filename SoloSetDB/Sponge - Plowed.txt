Verse:
[Ebm]Will I [Db/F]wake up? Some [Ab]dream I [Db/F]made up

Our [B]only chance to connect with a dream[Gb]

Pre-Chorus:
[Db]Say a prayer for me
[Badd9]      [Db]Say a prayer for me
[Badd9]      [Db]Say a prayer for me
[Badd9]I'm buried by the sound

Chorus:
Of a [Ebm]world of human wrec[Badd9]kage
In a [Ebm]world of human wrec[Badd9]kage
In a [Ebm]world of human wrec[Badd9]kage
Where I'm [Gb/Bb]lost and I'm found and I [Badd9]can't touch the ground
I'm plowed into the sound[Bmaj7][Ebm]

Verse:
[Ebm]To see wide [Db/F]open with a [Ab]head that's [Db/F]broken

The [B]message that is the seed[Gb]

Pre-Chorus:
[Db]Say a prayer for me
[Badd9]      [Db]Say a prayer for me
[Badd9]      [Db]Say a prayer for me
[Badd9]I'm buried by the sound

Chorus:
Of a [Ebm]world of human wrec[Badd9]kage
In a [Ebm]world of human wrec[Badd9]kage
In a [Ebm]world of human wrec[Badd9]kage
Where I'm [Gb/Bb]lost and I'm found and I [Badd9]can't touch the ground
I'm plowed into the sound[Bmaj7]

Outro:
[Ebm]Will I [Db/F]wake up? Some [Ab]dream I [Db/F]made up
