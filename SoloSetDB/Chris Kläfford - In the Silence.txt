Intro:
[G][Gmaj7][G]

Verse:
[G]I’m still seeking silver linings
[Csus2]Feeling incomplete
Singing o[G/E]h oh I wi[G/D]sh it didn't taste so bitter[G/C]sweet
[G]So enamored, stuttered, stammered[G/C], oh my voice was broke
Like a po[G/E]or man stood before the queen
I trip[G/D]ped over my tongue before I spo[G/C]ke

Chorus:
And tho[G/C]ugh I never said it [Dsus4]with wo[D]rds
There [G/B]was love in the sile[G/E]nce
Even no[G/C]w after all of these ye[Dsus4]ars[D]
You're the li[G/B]ght in my darknes[G/E]s
Verse:
[G]Used to share that feeling, dreaming,
[Csus2/G]gazing at the bedroom ceiling
[G/E]Oh oh    n[G/D]ow I lay here wishing you'd come [G/C]home

Chorus:
And tho[G/C]ugh I never said it [Dsus4]with wo[D]rds
There [G/B]was love in the sile[G/E]nce
Even no[G/C]w after all of these ye[Dsus4]ars[D]
You're the li[G/B]ght in my darknes[G/E]s

Darling plea[G/C]se
Listen close and you'[Dsus4]ll hear[D]
There's still[G/B] love in the s[G/E]ilence
Even n[G/C]ow after all these [Dsus4]long yea[D]rs
I feel [G/B]love in the qui[G/E]et
Bridge:
[G/C]Oh Ooh[G][Dsus4][D]
[G/C]Oh Ooh[G][Dsus4][D]

Chorus:
And tho[G/C]ugh I never said it [Dsus4]with wo[D]rds
There [G/B]was love in the sile[G/E]nce
Even no[G/C]w after all of these ye[Dsus4]ars[D]
You're the li[G/B]ght in my darknes[G/E]s

Darling plea[G/C]se
Listen close and you'[Dsus4]ll hear[D]
There's still[G/B] love in the s[G/E]ilence
Even n[G/C]ow after all these long[Dsus4] years[D]
I feel [G/B]love in the qui[G/E]et
