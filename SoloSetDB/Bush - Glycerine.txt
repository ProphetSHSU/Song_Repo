[F][C][Dm][Bb]

Verse:
[F]Must be your ski[C]n, I'm sinkin' [Dm]in.  Must be for r[Bb]eal,    'Cause now I can f[F]eel.
I didn't min[C]d,  It's not my k[Dm]ind.  It's not my t[Bb]ime,    To wonder w[F]hy.
Everything's gone whi[C]te, Everything's gr[Dm]ay.  Now you're h[Bb]ere, Now you're aw[F]ay.
Don't want th[C]is, Remember tha[Dm]t. I'll never for[Bb]get, Where you're a[F]t.

Chorus:
[C]Don't let the d[Dm]ays go [Bb]by.
Glycerin[F]e       [C]        [Bb]Glycerin[F]e

Instrumental:
[F][C][Bb][F]

Verse:
I'm never alo[C]ne, I'm alone all the ti[Dm]me. Are you at [Bb]one, Do you l[F]ie.
We live on a whe[C]el, Where everyone ste[Dm]als. And when we r[Bb]ise, It's like strawberry fi[F]elds.
Treated you b[C]ad, You bruise my f[Dm]ace. Couldn't love you m[Bb]ore, You've got a beautiful ta[F]ste.

Bridge:
[C]Don't let the da[Dm]ys go [Bb]by, C[F]ould've been ea[C]sier on yo[Dm]u.
I couldn't ch[Bb]ange, Though I wanted t[F]o.
Should've been e[C]asier by th[Dm]ree, Our old friend f[Bb]ear, and you and m[F]e.[C][Bb]
Glycerin[F]e               [C]        [Bb]Glycerin[F]e

[Dm]Glycerine       Gl[Bb]ycerine
[Dm]Bad moon white a[Bb]gain,   [Dm]Bad moon wh[Bb]ite again.
As she f[Dm]alls around me.[Bb][F]

Verse:
Needed you mo[C]re, You wanted us l[Dm]ess. Could not k[Bb]iss,    Just reg[F]ress.
It might just [C]be, Clear simple and pl[Dm]ain. Well that's just f[Bb]ine, That's just one of my n[F]ames.

Outro:
[C]Don't let the d[Dm]ays go [Bb]by,
C[F]ould have been ea[C]sier on [Dm]you. . .you. . .[Bb]you. . .
