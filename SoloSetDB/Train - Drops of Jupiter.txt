Intro:
[C][G][F][F]

Verse:
Now th[C]at she's back in the atmosphere
With dr[G]ops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, h[F]ey, hey, hey
She a[C]cts like summer and walks like rain
Rem[G]inds me that there's time to change, hey, h[F]ey, hey, hey
Si[C]nce the return from her stay on the moon
She li[G]stens like spring and she talks like June, hey, h[F]ey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Chorus:
[G]Tell me did you sail across the su[D]n
Did you make it to the Milky Wa[F]y to see the lights all faded
[C]And that heaven is overrated
[G]Tell me, did you fall from a shooting st[D]ar
One without a permanent sc[Dm]ar
And did you miss me while you were [F]looking for yourself out there

Instrumental Fill:
[C][G][F][F]

Verse:
Now th[C]at she's back from that soul vacation
[G]Tracing her way through the constellation, h[F]ey, hey, hey
She ch[C]ecks out Mozart while she does tae-bo
Rem[G]inds me that there's room to grow, hey,[F]hey, hey, hey
Now th[C]at she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afr[G]aid that she might think of me as pl[F]ain ol' Jane

Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land
Chorus:
[G]Tell me did the wind sweep you off your [D]feet
Did you finally get the chance to [F]dance along the light of day
[C]And head back to the Milky Way
And [G]tell me, did Venus blow your [D]mind
Was it everything you wanted to [Dm]find
And did you miss me while you were [F]looking for yourself out there

Instrumental:
[C][G][F][F]

Bridge:
Can you imagine no [C]love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your [G]best friend always sticking [F]up for you, even when I know you're wrong
Can you imagine no [C]first dance, freeze dried romance [G]five-hour phone conversation
The [Bb]best soy latte that you ever had, and[F]me

Chorus:
[G]Tell me did the wind sweep you off your [D]feet
Did you finally get the chance to [F]dance along the light of day
[C]And head back toward the Milky Way
[G]Tell me did you sail across the [D]sun
Did you make it to the Milky [F]Way to see the lights all faded
[C]And that heaven is overrated
[G]Tell me, did you fall from a shooting [D]star
One without a permanent [Dm]scar
And did you miss me while you were [F]looking for yourself

Outro:
[C]Na na na na na na
[G]Na na na na na na [F]na-na-na-na

And did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
[C]Na na na na na na
[G]Na na na na na na
            [F](na-na-na-na)
And did you fall from a shooting star, fall from a shooting star
[C]Na na na na na na
[G]Na na na na na na
And are ya [Bb]lonely looking for yourself o[F]ut there
