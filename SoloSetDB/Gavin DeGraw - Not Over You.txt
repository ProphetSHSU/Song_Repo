Intro:
[A] [Bm][F#m][E]

Verse:
[A]Dreams, that's where [Bm]I have to go[F#m]
to see your beaut[E]iful f[A]ace anymore
I s[Bm]tare at a pi[F#m]cture of you and listen to the ra[E]dio
[A]Hope, hope there's a[Bm] conversation[F#m]
where we both admit we had it[E]good but
[A]until then it's [Bm]alienation,[F#m] I know, that much is [E]understood
[D]And I realize

Chorus:
If you [A]ask me how I'm doin I would[D]say I'm doin just fine
I would[F#m] lie and say that [E]you're not on my[D]mind
But I [A]go out and I sit down at a [D]table set for two
and [F#m]finally I'm [E]forced to face the [D]truth
No matter [F#m]what they say, I[E]'m not over you
Not[A,] ov[Bm,]er y[F#m,]ou[E]

Verse 2:

[A]Damn, damn girl you d[Bm]o it well[F#m]
And I thought you were in[E]nocent
You[A] took this heart and [Bm]put it throu[F#m]gh hell
But still you're magnifi[E]cent
[A]I I'm a boomerang doe[Bm]sn't matter [F#m]how you throw [E]me
[A]Turn around and I'm b[Bm]ack in the g[F#m]ame
Even better than the old [E]me
(D)
But I'm not even close without you

Chorus:
If you [A]ask me how I'm doin I would[D]say I'm doin just fine
I would[F#m] lie and say that [E]you're not on my[D]mind
But I [A]go out and I sit down at a [D]table set for two
and [F#m]finally I'm [E]forced to face the [D]truth
No matter [F#m]what they say, I[E]'m not over you

Bridge:
[F#m]And if [E]I had the c[A]hance to [D]renew
[F#m]You know t[E]here isn't a [A]thing I wouldn't [D]do
I could [F#m]get back on the r[E]ight track
But o[A]nly if you'd be co[D]nvinced
[F#m]So until [E]then

Chorus:
If you [A]ask me how I'm doin I would[D]say I'm doin just fine
I would[F#m] lie and say that [E]you're not on my[D]mind
But I [A]go out and I sit down at a [D]table set for two
and [F#m]finally I'm [E]forced to face the [D]truth
No matter [F#m]what they say, I[E]'m not over you
[A,]Not[Bm,] ove[F#m,]r you[E]
[A,]Not[Bm,] ove[F#m,]r you[E]
[A,]Not[Bm,] ove[F#m,]r you[E]
