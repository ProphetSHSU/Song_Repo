[G] Come along with me [Bm]now 'cause there are
[C]Things I've been dying to [G]tell you
[G]The best or the [D]worst things that you
[Am]Never needed to [G]know
[G]This is the kind of [Bm]comedy where no one's
[C]Laughing 'cause it's [G]hard to...
[G]I'm a punch line who's [D]punch-drunk with my
[Am]Fist in a broken [C]mirror...

There's a [G]party near by
[D] I can [Am]hear
[G]Laughter in the [D]distance and it [Am]all comes [C]clear
[G]Sounds too simple,[D] but love is the [Am]only ans[Cm]wer
[Bm]Everything else i[Am]s just a train-wreck

[G][Bm][C][G]
[G][D][Am][G]

[G]Gonna stay up [Bm]all night every[C] night for the rest of[G]my life
[G]Till the lines around [D]my eyes grow [Am]deeper and more de[G]fined
[G]You might ask me "Aren't [Bm]you dead inside and[C] so damn[G]tired?"
[G]I say i have no i[D]dea but I'm not [Am]sleeping until [C]after the
dy[G]ing is over[D] I can [Am]hear
[G]Laughter in the [D]distance and it [Am]all comes [C]clear
[G]Sounds too simple,[D] but love is the [Am]only ans[Cm]wer
[Bm]Love's a trainwreck,[Am]you're a mistake
