[Abm] [Abm] [Ebm7] [Gb/Bb] [Badd9] [Abm] [Ebm7]
[Gb/Bb] [Badd9]

Verse 1:
[Abm]   Somewhere [Ebm7]there's speaking
[Gb/Bb]     It's alrea[Badd9]dy   coming in
[Abm]   Oh and [Ebm7]it's rising at the [Gb/Bb]back of your [Badd9]mind
[Abm]   You never [Ebm7]could get it
[Gb/Bb]     Unless you [Badd9]were fed it
[Abm]   Now you're[Ebm7]    here and you [Gb/Bb]don't know [Badd9]why
[Abm]   But under[Ebm7]    skinned knees and the[Gb/Bb]      [Badd9]skid marks
[Abm]   Past [Ebm7]the places where you [Gb/Bb]used to [Badd9]learn
[Abm]   You howl [Ebm7]and listen
[Gb/Bb]     Listen [Badd9]and  wait for the
[Abm]   Echoes [Ebm7]of  angels who [Gb/Bb]won't re[Badd9]turn

Chorus:
He's [Abm]everything [Gb]you want
He's [Ebm7]everything [Db]you need
He's [Abm]everything [Gb]inside of you
That [Ebm7]you wish you [Db]could be
He says [Abm]all the right[Gb]  things
At e[Ebm7]xactly the [Db]right time
But [Abm]he means no[Ebm7]thing to you
And you [Db]don't know[Badd9]     why
[Abm] [Ebm7] [Gb/Bb] [Badd9] [Abm] [Ebm7] [Gb/Bb] [Badd9]

Verse 2:
[Abm]   You're waiting [Ebm7]for someone
[Gb/Bb]     To put you[Badd9]     together
[Abm]   You're waiting [Ebm7]for someone to [Gb/Bb]push you a[Badd9]way
[Abm]   There's always[Ebm7]    another[Gb/Bb]     wound to[Badd9]     discover
[Abm]   There's always[Ebm7]    something more you [Gb/Bb]wish he'd [Badd9]say

Chorus:
He's [Abm]everything [Gb]you want
He's [Ebm7]everything [Db]you need
He's [Abm]everything [Gb]inside of you
That [Ebm7]you wish you [Db]could be
He says [Abm]all the right[Gb]  things
At e[Ebm7]xactly the [Db]right time
But [Abm]he means no[Ebm7]thing to you
And you [Db]don't know[Badd9]     why

Bridge:
[Ebm]   But you'll just sit tight
[B] And watch it unwind
[Ebm]   It's only what you're [Db]asking [B]for
[Ebm]   And you'll be just fine
[B] With all of your time
[Ebm]   It's only what you're [Db]waiting [B]for

Verse 3:
[Abm]   Out of [Ebm7]the island
[Gb/Bb]     Into [Badd9]the  highway
[Abm]   Past [Ebm7]the places where you [Gb/Bb]might have [Badd9]turned
[Abm]   You never [Ebm7]did notice
[Gb/Bb]     But you still[Badd9]     hide away
The[Abm]   anger [Ebm7]of  angels who [Gb/Bb]won't re[Badd9]turn

Chorus:
He's [Abm]everything [Gb]you want
He's [Ebm7]everything [Db]you need
He's [Abm]everything [Gb]inside of you
That [Ebm7]you wish you [Db]could be
He says [Abm]all the right[Gb]  things
At e[Ebm7]xactly the [Db]right time
But [Abm]he means no[Ebm7]thing to you
And you [Db]don't know[Badd9]     why
I am [Abm]everything [Gb]you want
I am [Ebm7]everything [Db]you need
I am [Abm]everything [Gb]inside of you
That [Ebm7]you wish you [Db]could be
I say [Abm]all the right[Gb]  things
At e[Ebm7]xactly the [Db]right time
But [Abm]I  mean no[Ebm7]thing to you and I [Db]don't know[Badd9]     why[Abm][Ebm7]

Outro:
[Gb/Bb]      [Badd9]     And I don't know[Abm]    [Ebm7]    why
[Gb/Bb]      [Badd9]     Why
[Abm]    [Ebm7]     [Gb/Bb]      [Badd9]     And I don't know[Abm][Ebm7][Gb/Bb][Badd9][Abm][Ebm7][Gb/Bb][Badd9]
