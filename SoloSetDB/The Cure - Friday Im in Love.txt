[Bm]Dressed up to the [C]eyes, it's a wonderful sur[D]prise

And as sleek as a s[A]hriek spinning round and round
[Bm]Always take a big [C]bite, it's such a gorgeous s[D]ight
To see yo[A]u eat in the middle of the [Bm]night
You can never get en[C]ough, enough of this [D]stuff
It's Friday[A]I'm in love
