Intro:
[G] [A][G][A][G][A][G][A][D][Dsus2][D]

Verse:
Y[D]ou know a dream is like a[Dsus2] river[D], ever cha[G]nging as it fl[D]ows.
And a dre[G]amer's just a ve[D/F#]ssel that must fo[Em]llow where it g[A]oes
Trying to le[D]arn from what's behind him
And never kn[Bm]owing what's in s[G]tore
Makes each d[D]ay a constant battle
Just to st[A]ay between the sh[D]ores.

Chorus 1:

A[D]nd I will sail my[Dsus2] vesse[D]l 'til the ri[G]ver runs d[D]ry,
Like a b[G]ird upon the [D/F#]wind these wa[Em]ters are my s[A]ky
I'll never r[D]each my destination i[G]f I never try
So I will s[D]ail my vessel 'til the ri[A]ver runs dr[D]y.[Dsus2][D]

Verse:
T[D]oo many times we stand [Dsus2]aside [D]and let the w[G]aters slip aw[D]ay
'Til what we p[G]ut off 'til t[D/F#]omorrow has[Em] now become t[A]oday
So don't you si[D]t upon the shoreline and s[Bm]ay you're sati[G]sfied
Ch[D]oose to chance the rapids and d[A]are to dance the t[D]ide.

Chorus 2:

A[D]nd I will sail my[Dsus2] vesse[D]l 'til the r[G]iver runs d[D]ry,
Like a b[G]ird upon the [D/F#]wind these w[Em]aters are my s[A]ky
I'll never re[D]ach my destination if I never t[G]ry
So I will s[D]ail my vessel 'til the r[A]iver runs dr[D]y.[Dsus2][D]

Bridge:
[D]    [Dsus2]   
And[D] there's [Bm]bound to be rough w[G]aters
And I k[D]now I'll take some f[G]alls
But with the g[Em]ood Lord as my ca[D/F#]ptain
I can m[G]ake it through them a[A]ll…[(changing][key][into][E)]

Final Chorus:
(no chords played or single strum on each chord during the first 2 lines)

And I will s[E]ail my vessel 'til the r[A]iver runs d[E]ry,
Like a b[A]ird upon the [E/G#]wind these w[F#m]aters are my s[B]ky
I'll never re[E]ach my destination [A]if I never try
So I will s[E]ail my vessel 'til the river ru[B]ns dry.[E][A]
Yes, I will s[E]ail my vessel
'Til the ri[B]ver runs d[A]ry...
'Til the river runs d[E]ry.
