[C][F][G][F]

Verse:
Oh well in [C]five years [F]time we could be [G]walking round a [F]zoo
With the [C]sun shining [F]down over [G]me and [F]you
And there'll be [C]love in the [F]bodies of the [G]elephants [F]too
And I'll put my [C]hands over y[F]our eyes, but [G]you'll peep [F]through

Chorus:
And there'll be [C]sun sun [F]sun
[G]All over our [F]bodies
And [C]sun sun [F]sun
[G]All down our [F]necks
And [C]sun sun [F]sun
[G]All over our [F]faces
And [C]sun sun [F]sun
[G]So what the [F]heck

Verse:
Cause I'll [C]be laughing[F] at all your sill[G]y little jokes[F]
And we'll[C] be laughing[F] about how[G] we use[F]d to smoke
All those stupid[C] little ciga[F]rettes
A[G]nd drink s[F]tupid wine
Cause it's[C] what we nee[F]ded to have a [G]good time[F]

Chorus:
[C]And it was fun fun f[F]un
Whe[G]n we were drinki[F]ng
[C]It was fun fun fun [F]

Whe[G]n we were laughi[F]ng
[C]It was fun fun fun [F]
Oh [G]it was fun [F]

Verse:
Oh well[C] I look at [F]you and say[G][F]
It's[C] the happies[F]t that I'v[G]e ever [F]been
And I'll say[C] I no longer[F] feel I ha[G]ve to b[F]e James Dean

And I'm al[C]ways pretty [F]happy when I'm[G] just kickin[F]g back with you

And[G] love love love [F]
[C]All through our mind[F]s
And[G] there'll be Lov[F]e love love
[C]All over her face [F]
And[G] Love love love [F]
[C]All over mine [F]

Verse:
Althoug[C]h maybe all[F] these moments ar[G]e just in my hea[F]d
I[C]'ll be thin[F]king about them a[G]s I'm lying in b[F]ed
And al[C]l that I be[F]lieve might never[G] really come tru[F]e
But in [C]my mind I'm[F] having a pretty [G]good time with y[F]ou

Chorus:
Oh 
Five years time 
I might not know you 
Five years time 
We might not speak 
Oh 
In five years time 
We might not get along 
In five years time 
You might just prove me wrong 
Oh there'll be love love love 
Wherever you go 
There'll be love love love 
Wherever you go 
There'll be love love love 
Wherever you go 
There'll be love love love 
Wherever you go 
There'll be love love love 
Wherever you go 
There'll be love love love 
Wherever you go 
There'll be love love love 
Wherever you go there'll be love
