Verse:
[G]And to love [D]     [Dsus4]      [D]    a [G]god
And to fear  [D]     [Dsus4]      [D]    a fl[Em]ame
And to burn[Bm7]
A cr[Cadd9]owd that has a name

And to right or wrong
And to meek or strong
It is known
Just scream it from a wall

[Dsus2]I've willed, I've walked
I've read, I've talked
I know, I know
I've been here before

Chorus:
[Em]Hey, hey, hey,[A] now we won't be raped[Em:]
Hey, hey, [A]now we won't be scarred like that[Em]
Hey, hey, [A]now we won't be raped[Em]
Hey, hey, [A]now we won't be scarred like tha[Cadd9]t

Verse:
[G]It's the song[D]      [Dsus4]      [D]     that bur[G]ns
It's the wheel [D]     [Dsus4]      [D]    that tu[Em]rns
It's the way[Bm7]
We s[Cadd9]ing that makes 'em dream

And to Christ, a cross
And to me, a chair
I will sit
And earn the ransom from up here

I've willed, I've walked
I've read, I've talked
I know, I know
I've been here before

Chorus:
[Em]Hey, hey, hey, [A]now we won't be raped[Em]
Hey, hey, [A]now we won't be scarred like that[Em]
Hey, hey, [A]now we won't be raped[Em]
Hey, hey, [A]now we won't be scarred like tha[Csus2]t
[Dsus2]Scarred like that

Solo:
[Esus2] [Dsus2][Csus2][G][D][G][D]

And to love a god
And to fear a flame
And to burn
A crowd that has a name
