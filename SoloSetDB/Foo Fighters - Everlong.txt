[D7M]Hello,
I've [Bsus2]waited here for you[Gsus2]     ever[Bsus2]long.

[D7M]Come down and [Bsus2]waste away with me,
[Gsus2]     Down with[Bsus2]me.

[D7M]    [A5]  And I[D7M]wonder,

If everything could ev[G5]er feel this real for[D5]ever,
[B5]  If anything could ev[G5]er be this good a[D5]gain.

You've got to promise not [A5]to stop when I say[G5]when,
She sang.

[D7M]Breathe out so [Bsus2]I    can breathe you in,

[Gsus2]     Out of your head,[Bsus2]out of my head I sang.
