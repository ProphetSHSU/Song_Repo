Intro:
[Cadd9][C][Cmaj7][C][Cadd9][C][Cmaj7][C]

Verse:
[Cadd9][C][Cmaj7][C][Cadd9][C][Cmaj7][C]

Sweet is the s[Asus2]ight[Am][Asus4][Am][Cadd9][C][Cmaj7][C]
Of her room
Window open by candlelight
How would you know?
Cold winter on the shore
Chills the dress she wore
It's on the floor
Still it feels so warm   today

Chorus 1:
And that's why I'm [F]wondering[G] why you [C]had to[Am]tell me
[F]What's [G]going [C]on in your head, [Am]what's wrong,[F]
Come aro[G]und to an[C]other ti[Am]me when you[F] don't ha[G]ve to r[Am]un[Asus2]
And when[F] she says she wants[G]somebody else
I hope you [Am]know that she doesn't me[C]an you and
Wh[F]en she breaks down an[G]d makes a sound
Yo[Am]u'll never hear her th[C]e way that I do[Em][F][C][Em][F]

Verse:
Swing into flight
Over hills
Over her hills, it's twilight
Yeah, I guess that's right now
While were here
Tell me why it's so funny
That you're so funny when you're mad
Always so mad so mad

Chorus 2:
And that's why I'm w[F]ondering [G]why you h[C]ad to [Am]tell me
[F]What's [G]going [C]on in your head, [Am]what's wrong,[F]
Come [G]around to[C] another[Am] time when [F]you don't[G] have t[Am]o run[Asus2]
And w[F]hen she says she wa[G]nts somebody else
I hope you k[Am]now that she doesn't mea[C]n you and
When [F]she breaks down and m[G]akes a sound
You'l[Am]l never hear her the w[C]ay that I do
And when[F] she says she want[G]s someone to love
I hope y[Am]ou know that she doesn'[C]t mean you
And when[F] she breaks down and l[G]ets you down
I hope y[Am]ou know she doesn'[C]t mean you[Em][F][G][Am]
Yeah and I[Em] don't kno[F]w where
C[G]ome and f[Am]ind me
[Em]I don't k[F]now what
We're [G]coming [Am]to and

Outro:
[Em]I don't k[F]now what
It me[G]ans to [Am]me and
Y[Em]ou don't k[F]now what
It m[G]eans to y[Am]ou
