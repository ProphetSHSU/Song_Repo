Verse:
I [C]had a dream so big and loud

I jumped so high I touched the clouds
W[F]o-o-o-o-o-oh
W[F]o-o-o-o-o-oh
I [C]stretched my hands out to the sky

We danced with monsters through the night
W[F]o-o-o-o-o-oh
W[F]o-o-o-o-o-oh

Pre-Chorus:
I'm [Am]never gonna look back
Woah, [C]never gonna give it up
No, [F]please don't wake me now

Chorus:
[C]Oo-o-o-o-oo
This is gonna be the best day of my [F]li-ife

My li-i-i-i-i-ife
[C]Oo-o-o-o-oo
This is gonna be the best day of my [F]li-ife
My li-i-i-i-i-ife[C][F]

Verse:
I [C]howled at the moon with friends

And then the sun came crashing in
W[F]o-o-o-o-o-oh
W[F]o-o-o-o-o-oh
But [C]all the possibilities

No limits, just epiphanies
W[F]o-o-o-o-o-oh
W[F]o-o-o-o-o-oh

Pre-Chorus:
I'm [Am]never gonna look back
Woah, [C]never gonna give it up
No, [F]just don't wake me now

Chorus:
[C]Oo-o-o-o-oo
This is gonna be the best day of my [F]li-ife

My li-i-i-i-i-ife
[C]Oo-o-o-o-oo
This is gonna be the best day of my [F]li-ife
My li-i-i-i-i-ife[C][F]

Bridge:
[C]I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul (soul)
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control (control)

Chorus:
[C]Oo-o-o-o-oo
[C]     This is gonna be the best day of my [F]li-ife

My li-i-i-i-i-ife
[C]Oo-o-o-o-o
This is gonna be the best day of my [F]li-ife

My li-i-i-i-i-ife
[C]This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
The best day of my [F]life

Everything is looking up, everybody up now
[C]   This is gonna be the best day of my [F]li-ife
My li-i-i-i-i-ife[C]
