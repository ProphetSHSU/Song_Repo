Verse:
[C]I don't know if [G]you can see,
The [Am]changes that have come [F]over me.
In these [C]last few days I've [G]been afraid,
That I [Am]might drift [F]away.
I've been [C]telling stories, [G]singing songs,
That [Am]make me think about [F]where I come from.
[C]That's the reason [G]why I seem
So [Am]far away [F]today.

Chorus:
[C]Let me tell you that I [G]love you,
That I [Am]think about you all the [F]time.
Caledonia you're [C]calling me,
Now I'm [G]going [C]home.
But [C]if I shall become a [G]stranger,
Know that [Am]it would make me more than [F]sad,
Caledonia's been [G]everything I've ever [C]had.

Verse:
[C]Now I have moved an[G]d kept on moving,
[Am]Proved the points th[F]at I needed proving,
[C]Lost the friends[G]that I needed losing,
[Am]Found others on [F]the way.
[C]I have tried and kept on[G]trying,
[Am]Stolen dreams, yes th[F]ere's no denying,
[C]I have travelled hard sometimes [G]with conscience flying,
[Am]Somewhere with t[F]he wind.

Chorus:
[C]Let me tell you that I [G]love you,
That I [Am]think about you all the [F]time.
Caledonia you're [C]calling me,
Now I'm [G]going [C]home.
But [C]if I shall become a [G]stranger,
Know that [Am]it would make me more than [F]sad,
Caledonia's been [G]everything I've ever [C]had.

Verse:
[C]Now I'm sitting here be[G]fore the fire,
[Am]The empty room, [F]a forest choir,
The [C]flames that couldn't[G]get any higher,
They've withe[Am]red now the[F]y've gone.
But[C] I'm steady thinking m[G]y way is clear,
[Am]And I know what I will d[F]o tomorrow,
[C]When hands have shaken, [G]and kisses flown,
[Am]Then I wil[F]l disappear.

Chorus:
[C]Let me tell you that I [G]love you,
That I [Am]think about you all the [F]time.
Caledonia you're [C]calling me,
Now I'm [G]going [C]home.
But [C]if I shall become a [G]stranger,
Know that [Am]it would make me more than [F]sad,
Caledonia's been [G]everything I've ever [C]had.
