Verse:
I will always re[E]member the day you kissed my lips
[B]Light as a [C#m]feather
And it went just like this
No, it's [G#m]never been [A]better
Than the summer[B] of two thousand and two[E]
We were only e[E]leven
But acting like grownups
Like we [B]are in the [C#m]present,
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing, [G#m]"love is for[A]ever and ever"
[B] Well, I guess that was true[E]

Pre-Chorus:
Dan[C#m]cing on the hood [A]in the middle of the woods
Of an [E]old Mustang,[B]where we sang
[A]Songs with all our childhood friends[B]
And it went like this, yeah

Chorus:
[A]Oops I[E] got ninety-nine [B]problems singing bye, [C#m]bye, bye
Hold up, [A]if you wanna go and [E]take a ride with me
Better [B]hit me, baby, one [C#m]more time
[A]Paint a picture[E]for you and me
Of the [B]days when we were[C#m]young
[A]Singing at the top of both our lungs[B]
Now we're under the [E]covers

Verse:
Fast forward to eighteen
We are [B]more than [C#m]lovers
Yeah, we are all we need
When we're [G#m]holding each [A]other
I'm taken back[B] to two thousand and two[E]

Pre-Chorus:
Dan[C#m]cing on the hood [A]in the middle of the woods
Of an [E]old Mustang,[B]where we sang
[A]Songs with all our childhood friends[B]
And it went like this, yeah

Chorus:
[A]Oops I[E] got ninety-nine [B]problems singing bye, [C#m]bye, bye
Hold up, [A]if you wanna go and [E]take a ride with me
Better [B]hit me, baby, one [C#m]more time
[A]Paint a picture[E]for you and me
Of the [B]days when we were[C#m]young
[A]Singing at the top of both our lungs[B]
On the day we fell in love

Post-Chorus:
[E] O[B]oh O[C#m]oh On[A]
the day we fell in love
[E] O[B]oh O[C#m]oh [A]

Bridge:
Dan[C#m]cing on the hood [A]in the middle of the woods
Of an [E]old Mustang,[B]where we sang
[A]Songs with all our childhood friends[B]
Oh, now

Chorus:
[A]Oops I[E] got ninety-nine [B]problems singing bye, [C#m]bye, bye
Hold up, [A]if you wanna go and [E]take a ride with me
Better [B]hit me, baby, one [C#m]more time
[A]Paint a picture[E]for you and me
Of the [B]days when we were[C#m]young
[A]Singing at the top of both our lungs[B]
On the day we fell in love

Outro:
[E] O[B]oh O[C#m]oh On[A]
the day we fell in love[E] O[B]
oh O[C#m]oh On[A]
the day we fell in love
[E] O[B]oh O[C#m]oh On[A]
the day we fell in love[E] O[B]
oh O[C#m]oh On[A]
the day we fell in love,[A]love, love
