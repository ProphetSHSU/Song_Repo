[G]What's this new air you have draped about you?
Do you know what you're going into?
Can yo[D]u feel a change from inside?
You're not the s[G]ame, you no longer want to hide

What's this new air you breathe from within?
It's telling you there's a new place
To[D]begin again -- with the morning's light
You wake up smil[G]ing, you wake up feeling all right

Chorus 1:
Stea[C]dy on, like the honke[D]rs that pass through the air
You [G]can hear them[G/F#] coming and [Em]you step out and stare
Th[C]ey're in chevron formation an[D]d they'll follow their leader
Wh[C]o'll tire when she's flown th[D]rough the sun[G]shine and the thunder

[G]Your legs are thin when you stand in the sea
They move you swiftly down the back rounds of the country
Maybe [D]now you should check your speed
An[G]d don't forget to chase the whispers of your dreams

'Cuz[C] you're hunting like [D]the hawk that circles higher
You'[G]re the rising[G/F#] smoke from [Em]a dyin' campfire
Yo[C]u're a thermal beneath the wi[D]ng, you're cirrus in the sky
Yo[C]u're a reason for, yo[D]u're an a[G]nswer why

[G]Your arms are strong when you fly through the air
Over streets and bui[D]ldings and the people below you stare
They c[Em]an't believe, 'cuz they've never seen
[F]Someone who dared[D]fly (high) outside their dreams

(…Thunder…You are rising, like cirrus, cirrus in the sky.  You are, you are hunting like the hawk, rising like the smoke…from a dying campfire.  You are rising like cirrus in the sky.  You are, you are…steady on.  Their leader, oh their leader – “and the thunder” TOGETHER)
