Verse:
[B]Cemetery kids on a midnight clear

Saying Bloody Mary in the bathroom mirror
[E]Sneaking Natty Lights down the stairs of the basement

Ain’t much to do but the night’s what you make it

[B]Running down a dream on Stephen King & Kerouac

Children of the Corn Pink House Pink Cadillac
[E]It’s not just any old patch of pitchfork dirt
[E]Stop me if you’ve already heard

The one about….

Chorus:
[B]Mellencamp Springsteen marijuana seventeen

White frost bean field bonfire kerosene
[E]Red Bic lighter in a blue jean pocket

Lost in the land of American Gothic yeah

Verse:
[B]Watching Days Of Our Lives on a second hand couch

Nicotine soaked wood panels of the house
[E]Sugar coated Wonder Bread tastes like candy
[E]Black lipstick first kiss in a Camry
[E]Looks a little like…

Looks a little like…

Chorus:
[B]Mellencamp Springsteen marijuana seventeen

White frost bean field bonfire kerosene
[E]Red Bic lighter in a blue jean pocket
[E]Lost in the land of American Gothic yeah

[E]Real life living

Real life living

Bridge:
[F#]Going with the grain

Where the colors ain’t fading
[E]Real life living in a real life painting
[E]Looks a little like…

Looks a little like…

Chorus:
[B]Mellencamp Springsteen marijuana seventeen

White frost bean field bonfire kerosene
[E]Red Bic lighter in a blue jean pocket

Lost in the land of American Gothic yeah

Chorus:
[B]Mellencamp Springsteen marijuana seventeen

No plans sun tan laying on a trampoline
[E]Red Bic lighter in a blue jean pocket
[E]Lost in the land of American Gothic yeah

[E]Real life living
[E]Real life living

Real life living in a real life painting
