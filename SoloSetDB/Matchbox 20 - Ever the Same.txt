Verse:
[C]We were drawn from the weeds[G]
We were brave like sol[F]diers
Falling [Am]down under the[G] pale moo[C]nlight
You were holding to [G]me
Like a someone b[F]roken
And I couldn't [Am]tell you but I'm[G] telling you[F]now

Pre-Chorus:
Just let me [Am]hold you while you're[G] falling apar[F]t
Just let me [Am]hold you and we'll[G] both fall dow[C]n

Chorus:
Fall on me[G]
Tell me e[Am]verything you want me to[F]be
Forever with you[C] forever in me[G]
Ever the same[F]

Verse:
[C]We would stand in the wind[G]
We were free like w[F]ater
Flowing [Am]down Under the[G] warmth of the[C]sun
Now it's cold and we're [G]scared
And we've both been s[F]haken
Look at us [Am]now this doesn't[G] need to be the[F]end
Pre-Chorus:
Just let me [Am]hold you while you're[G] falling apar[F]t
Just let me [Am]hold you and we'll[G] both fall dow[C]n

Chorus:
Fall on me[G]
Tell me e[Am]verything you want me to[F]be
Forever with you[C] forever in me[G]
Ever the same[C]

Call on me[G]
I'll be [Am]there for you and you'll be[F]there for me
Forever it's you[C]
Forever in me[G]
Ever the same[F]

Bridge:
[F]You may [G]need me there
[Am]To carry all your weight
[F]But you're no [G]burden I [Am]assure
[C]You tide me over[G]
With a [Am]warmth I'll not forge[F]t
But I can only[G] give you love[C]
Chorus:
Fall on me[G]
Tell me e[Am]verything you want me to[F]be
Forever with you[C] forever in me[G]
Ever the same[C]

Call on me[G]
I'll be [Am]there for you and you'll be[F]there for me
Forever it's you[C]
Forever in me[G]
Ever the same[Am]
