Intro:
[Dm][Am][Bb]

[Dm][Am][Bb]

I could st[Dm]and behind my barricad[Am]e[Bb]
Do what I’m t[Dm]old and be afraid to chang[Am]e[Bb]
While isol[Dm]ated by the mainstrea[Am]m[Bb]
With the c[Dm]urrent up against m[Am]e[Bb]

Well m[Dm]aybe if my arms were t[Am]en feet t[Bb]all
[Dm]I could finally reach that cr[Am]ystal b[Bb]all

‘Cause [Bb]I still f[F]ind ins[Am]ide
There’s something br[Bb]aver
And [Bb]I, I won’t b[F]e, I won’t b[Am]e
The silent damn[Bb]ation

[Dm]I will never be v[C]oiceless
My weapon of ch[Am]oice is
I’d rather be d[Bb]angerous
[Dm]I won’t be left def[C]enseless
As God as my w[Am]itness
I’d rather be d[Bb]angerous, dangerous

I’m not m[Dm]aking conversatio[Am]n[Bb]
But I’ll st[Dm]ate my observation[Am]s[Bb]
Well [Dm]I could buy my faith like a pl[Am]ot in the gr[Bb]ound
But [Dm]I was never lost and I n[Am]ever had a d[Bb]oubt

‘Cause [Bb]I still f[F]ind, it’s not m[Am]y imagin[Bb]ation
And [Bb]I won’t b[F]e, I won’t b[Am]e the silent damn[Bb]ation

[Dm]I will never be v[C]oiceless
My weapon of ch[Am]oice is
I’d rather be d[Bb]angerous
[Dm]I won’t be left def[C]enseless
As God as my w[Am]itness
I’d rather be d[Bb]angerous, d[Gm]angerous

[Dm]Everybody [Em]is somebody
And [F]anybody is y[Gm]ou
I [Dm]own my story, I w[Em]on’t say sorry
[F] And neither should y[Gm]ou

[Dm][Am][Bb][F][Gm]
[Dm]    [Em]    [F]   [Gm]I will never be

[Dm]I will never be v[C]oiceless
My weapon of ch[Am]oice is
I’d rather be d[Bb]angerous
[Dm]I won’t be left def[C]enseless
As God as my w[Am]itness
I’d rather be d[Bb]angerous
[Dm]Everybody [C]is somebody
And [Am]anybody is y[Bb]ou

[Dm]I will never be v[Em]oiceless (Will never be v[F]oiceless)
As God as my w[Gm]itness (God as my witness)
[Dm]I won’t be left def[Em]enseless
As God as my w[F]itness
I’d rather be d[Gm]angerous, d[Gm]anger[Dm]ous
