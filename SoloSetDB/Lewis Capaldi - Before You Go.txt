Intro:
[D]

Verse:
[D]I fell by the wayside, like everyone else
[Bm]I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, but I was just kidding myself
[G]Our every moment, I start to replace
[Asus4]  ‘cause now that they’re gone all I [A]hear are the words that I needed to say

Pre-Chorus:
[D]When you hurt under the surface
[Bm]  Like troubled water running [G]cold
Well time can heal but this [Asus4]won't[A]

Chorus 1:
[D]So
Before you [A]go
Was there some[Bm]thing I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If [G]only I'd have known you had a [A]storm to weather
[D]So
Before you [A]go
Was there some[Bm]thing I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It k[G]ills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
[A]So
Before you [D]go

Verse:
[D]Was never the right time, whenever you called
[Bm]Went little by little by little, until there was nothing at all
[G]Our every moment, I start to replay
[Asus4]  When all I can think about is [A]seeing that look on your face

Pre-Chorus:
[D]When you hurt under the surface
[Bm] Like troubled water running c[G]old
Well time can heal but this [Asus4]won't[A]

Chorus 2:
[D]So
Before you [A]go
Was there some[Bm]thing I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If o[G]nly I'd have known you had a [A]storm to weather
[D]So
Before you [A]go
Was there some[Bm]thing I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It [G]kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
[A]So
Before you [Bm]go

Bridge:
[Bm]Would we be [G]better off by [D]now?
If I'd [A]let my walls come [Bm]down?
Maybe I [G]guess we’ll never k[A]now
[A]You know, you k[D]now

Chorus 3:
Before you [A]go
Was there some[Bm]thing I coulda said to make your heart beat better?
If [G]only I'd have known you had a [A]storm to weather
[D]So
Before you [A]go
Was there some[Bm]thing I coulda said to make it all stop hurting?
It [G]kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
[A]So
Before you [D]go
