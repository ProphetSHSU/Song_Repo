Verse:
I've never seen a d[D]iamond in the flesh
I cut my [D]teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not [D]proud of my address - in the torn up town

No postcode envy

Pre-Chorus:
But every song's like: g[D]old teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom

Blood stains, ballgowns, trashin' the hotel room
[C]We don't care - we're driving [G]Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like [D]Cristal, Mayback, diamonds on your timepiece

Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
[C]We don't care - we aren't [G]caught up in your love affair

Chorus:
And we'll never be [D]royals - It don't run in our blood
That kind of [C]lux just ain't for us
We crave a [G]different kind of buzz
Let me be your [D]ruler - you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll [C]rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
[G]  Let me live that fantasy[D]

Verse:
My friends and [D]I, we've cracked the code
We count our [D]dollars on the train to the party
And every[D]one who knows us knows that we're fine with this

We didn't come from money

Pre-Chorus:
But every song's like: [D]gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom

Blood stains, ballgowns, trashin' the hotel room
[C]We don't care - we're driving [G]Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like [D]Cristal, Mayback, diamonds on your timepiece

Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
[C]We don't care - we aren't [G]caught up in your love affair

Chorus:
And we'll never be [D]royals - It don't run in our blood
That kind of [C]lux just ain't for us
We crave a [G]different kind of buzz
Let me be your [D]ruler - you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll [C]rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
[G]  Let me live that fantasy[D]

{c:quieter - talky}
Bridge:
oh ooh oh ohh
We're big[C]ger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love[G]with being queen (king)
[D]oh ooh oh ohh
[C]Life's a game without a care
We aren't [G]caught up in your love affair

Chorus:
And we'll never be [D]royals - It don't run in our blood
That kind of [C]lux just ain't for us
We crave a [G]different kind of buzz
Let me be your [D]ruler - you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll [C]rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
[G]  Let me live that fantasy[D]
