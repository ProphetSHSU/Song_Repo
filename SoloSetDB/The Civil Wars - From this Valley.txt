Intro:
[G]

to [D]wash down [C]over [G]me.

Chorus:
Oh, won't you [C]take me from this [G]valley
[C]to that mountain high [D]above?
I will [G]pray, pray, [D]pray
until I [Em]see your smiling [C]face.
I will [G]pray, pray, [D]pray
to the one I [G]love.

Verse:
[G]Oh, the outcast dreams of acceptance,
just to [D]find pure [C]love's em[G]brace
[G]like an orphan longs for his mother.
May [D]you hold me [C]in your [G]grace.

Oh, won't you [C]take me from this [G]valley
[C]to that mountain high [D]above?

I will [G]pray, pray, [D]pray
to the one I [G]love.

[G]Oh, the caged bird dreams of a strong wind
that will [D]flow 'neath her [C]wings.
[G]Like a voice longs for a melody,
oh, [D]Jesus carry [G]me.

Oh, won't you [C]take me from this [G]valley

to the one I [G]love.
