Intro:
[G][G/F#][Em][D]

[G][G/F#][Em][D]

Verse:
He[G]llo there, the [G/F#]angel from my nightmare
The [Em]shadow in the background of the [D]morgue
The unsuspecting [G]victim of [G/F#]darkness in the valley
We can [Em]live like Jack and Sally if we [D]want
Where you can always [G]find me
We'll have [G/F#]Halloween on Christmas
And [Em]in the night we'll wish this never [D]ends
We'll wish this never e[G]nds

Pre-Chorus:
[G]   [Gmaj9/F#]          [Em]    [D]    [C]   ([Cm]I miss you)
[G]   [Gmaj9/F#]          [Em]    [D]    [C]   ([Cm]I miss you)

Verse:
Where [G]are you and [G/F#]I'm so sorry
I [Em]cannot sleep I cannot dream to[D]night
I need somebody and [G]always
This [G/F#]sick strange darkness
Comes [Em]creeping on so haunting every [D]time
And as I stared I [G]counted
[G/F#]Webs from all the spiders
[Em]Catching things and eating their in[D]sides
Like indecision to [G]call you
and [G/F#]hear your voice of treason
Will [Em]you come home and stop this pain to[D]night

Stop this pain tonight

Chorus:
[G]Don't waste your t[G/F#]ime  on   m[Em]e you're alr[D]eady
The [C]voice inside my [Cm]head (I miss you, miss you)
[G]Don't waste your t[G/F#]ime  on   m[Em]e you're alr[D]eady
The [C]voice inside my [Cm]head (I miss you, miss you)

[G]Don't waste your t[G/F#]ime  on   m[Em]e you're alr[D]eady
The [C]voice inside my [Cm]head (I miss you, miss you)
[G]Don't waste your t[G/F#]ime  on   m[Em]e you're alr[D]eady
The [C]voice inside my [Cm]head (I miss you, miss you)
