Verse 1:
[Em]Lonely in this [C]crowd, 
I sit a[G]lone o
[Em]One more drink a [C]way 
from heading [G] home, oh 

[Em]Oh, I could 
[C]feel the night slipping by 
[G]Oh, away from [D]me 

And, [Em]oh, she 
[C]caught my eye through the light 
[G]Then she came right up to [D]me 

Chorus 1:
She said, [Em]"Oh, hi, nice to meet you 
[C]Tonight, maybe we could 
[G]Go dance, get up 
off our [D]feet" 

She said, [Em]"This life ain't forever 
[C]One song, here together 
[G]Then let's play it on re[D]peat" 

We could dance, we could dance all [Em]night 
We could dance 'til the morning [C]light 
Let's forget about our [G]worries 
and the wild world out[D]side

Verse 2:
She [Em]took my hand 
and [C]led me through the [G]dark, oh 

She said, [Em]"Feel the beat, 
for[C]get that broken [G]heart" oh 

And, [Em]oh, I can [C]feel the night slipping by 
[G]Oh, away from [D]me 

And, [Em]oh, I [C]saw the light in her eyes 
[G]Glad she came right up to [D]me
