Intro:
[D7][G][D7][G][D7]

Verse 1:
[G]     My head is stuck in the [D7]clouds
[G]     She begs me to come [D7]down, says:
[Em]“Boy, quit [D]fooling around.”[C]
I [D]told her
[G]     I love the view from up [D7]here
[G]     Warm sun and wind in my [D7]ear, we’ll
[Em]Watch the world[D] from above[C]
As it turns[D] to the rhythm of[G]love

Chorus:
[G7]     We may [C]only have tonight[G]
But [G7]‘til the [C]morning sun you’re mine[G]
[B7/F#]All     [Em]mine
Play the [D]music low[C]
And sway[D7] to the rhythm of[G]love

Verse 2:
[G]     Well, my heart beat like a [D7]drum
[G]     A guitar string to the [D7]strum, a
[Em]Beautiful [D]song to be[C]sung
[D]She’s got
[G]     Blue eyes deep like the [D7]sea
[G]     That roll back when she’s laughing at [D7]me, she
[Em]Rises up[D] like the tide[C]
The mo - [D]ment her lips meet [G]mine

Bridge:
[B]     When the [C]moon is [G]low,[D/F#]
[B]     We can [C]dance in [G]slow [D/F#]mo  -  [C]tion
And all your [D]tears will sub - [C]side
And all your [D]tears will[G]dry

Interlude:
[G]Ba, ba, (ba, [Gmaj9]ba)   ba,  [D6]ba,  [G]ba, ba, (ba, [Gmaj9]ba,) ba, [D6]ba,
[Em]Da, da, da [D]dum, da da [C]dum[D7]
Verse 3:
[G]     And long after I’ve [D7]gone
[G]     You’ll still be humming a – [D7]long and
[Em]I will keep[D] you in my [C]mind
The [D]way you make love so [G]fine.

Tag:

[D7]     Oh, [Em]play the [D]music low[C]
And sway[D7] to the rhythm of[G] love[D7][G]
And sway[D7] to the rhythm of[G] love[D7][G]
