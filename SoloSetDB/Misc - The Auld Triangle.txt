Verse:
A[G] hungry feeling Came[Bm]o'er me stealing
And the [C]mice were [G]squealing In my [A]prison [C]cell
And that[G] Auld Triangle went [Bm]jingle-jangle
All a[C]long the [G]banks of the R[D]oyal Ca[G]nal

Verse:
To be[G]gin the morning the [Bm]screw bawling
"Get [C]up out of [G]bed, boy! And [A]Clean up your [C]cell!"
And that [G]Auld Triangle went j[Bm]ingle-jangle
All a[C]long the [G]banks of the R[D]oyal Ca[G]nal

Verse:
On a [G]fine Spring evening, The [Bm]lag lay dreaming
And the [C]sea-gulls [G]squealing [A]High above the [C]wall
And that[G] Auld Triangle went [Bm]jingle-jangle
All a[C]long the [G]banks of the R[D]oyal Ca[G]nal

Verse:
Oh! The [G]day was dying And the [Bm]wind was sighing
As I [C]lay there [G]crying In [A]my prison [C]cell
And that [G]Auld Triangle went j[Bm]ingle-jangle
All a[C]long the [G]banks of the R[D]oyal Ca[G]nal

Verse:
Oh! The [G]screw was peeping and the [Bm]lag was sleeping
As he [C]lay there [G]weeping, For [A]his poor [C]gal
And that[G] Auld Triangle went [Bm]jingle-jangle
All a[C]long the [G]banks of the R[D]oyal Ca[G]nal

Verse:
In the [G]female prison There are [Bm]seventy women
And I [C]wish to god it was with [A]them That I did [C]dwell
And that [G]Auld Triangle went j[Bm]ingle-jangle
All a[C]long the [G]banks of the R[D]oyal Ca[G]nal x2
