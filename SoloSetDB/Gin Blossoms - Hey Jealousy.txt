Verse:
Tell me do you [C]think it’d be all [D]right, If I could [Em]just crash here[D]tonight
You can see [C]I’m in no shape for [D]driving, And anyway [Em]I've got no place to[D]go
And you know it [C]might not be that [D]bad, You were the [Em]best I’d ever[D]had
If I hadn't [C]blown the whole thing [D]years ago, I [Em]might not be [D]alone

Chorus:
Tomorrow we can [G]drive around this [C]town, And let the [G]cops chase us a[C]round
The past is gone but [Em]something might be[D] found, To take its[C]place
Hey jealou[C]sy, [D]  Hey jealou[Em]sy[D]
Hey jealou[C]sy, [D]  Hey jealou[Em]sy[D]

Verse:
And you can [C]trust me not to [D]think, And [Em]not to sleep [D]around
If you [C]don’t expect too [D]much from me, You [Em]might not be let[D]down
Cause all I really [C]want is to be with [D]you, Feeling [Em]like I matter[D]too
If I hadn't [C]blown the whole thing [D]years ago, I [Em]might be here with[D]you

Tomorrow we can [G]drive around this [C]town, And let the [G]cops chase us a[C]round
