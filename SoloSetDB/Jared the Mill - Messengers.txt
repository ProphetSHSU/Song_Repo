Intro:
[G][C][G]

Verse:
[G]If you're looking for her,

she's right down the road.
She'll be s[Cadd9]itting on a swing in the sun
making stones turn into g[G]old.
Let her k[D]now that the family she k[Cadd9]new
keeps her locket and k[G]eys.
Tell her e[D]verything is fine
and she's m[Cadd9]issed like the winds miss the t[G]rees.

Verse:
[G]And if you're searching for her,

she's out shedding light.
She's the [Cadd9]one you can't miss
'cause her smile makes the sun seem less b[G]right.
But if you f[D]ind her, be still
tell her e[Cadd9]verything about the time you've k[G]illed.
Let her k[D]now that the bad times will [Cadd9]pass
and I miss her like h[G]ell.

Chorus:
[Cadd9]Tell her I'm l[G]ost,
but that's alr[D]ight,
'cause after t[Emi]wenty-something y[D]ears, I can [Cadd9]barely walk the l[G]ine.
Only m[Emi]essengers can t[D]ell her how I'm m[Cadd9]issing her t[G]onight.
Verse:
[G]If you're searching for worth,

you'll find it with her,
but she'll [Cadd9]ask for your trust
'cause it's hard being shown how to l[G]earn.
So let her k[D]now that the stars haven't [Cadd9]moved;
God, I hope they're the s[G]ame.
Tell her l[D]ife could be worse,
and I'm t[Cadd9]rying my best now to c[G]hange.

Chorus:
[Cadd9]Tell her I'm l[G]ost,
but that's al[D]right,
'cause after tw[Emi]enty-something y[D]ears, I can b[Cadd9]arely walk the l[G]ine.
Only m[Emi]essengers can t[D]ell her how I'm m[Cadd9]issing her t[G]onight.

Verse:
[G]But if it's after the dawn,

be sure you're alone,
'cause she's the [Cadd9]kind best enjoyed like a pool under cottonwoods and st[G]ones.
So let her la[D]ugh wash you clean,
like the [Cadd9]rains on the tilted window pa[G]nes.
Give her eve[D]rything and more,
and she'll [Cadd9]give you the world in exc[G]hange.
Chorus:
[Cadd9]Tell her I'm l[G]ost,
but that's alr[D]ight,
'cause after tw[Emi]enty-something ye[D]ars, I can [Cadd9]barely walk the l[G]ine.
Only mes[Emi]sengers can t[D]ell her how I'm m[Cadd9]issing her to[G]night.

Bridge:
And tell her e[Emi]verything is good,
but I [Cadd9]miss how her eyes would t[G]ake me h[D]ome.
And tell her l[Emi]ife is getting faster
and I [Cadd9]miss the way she'd make you m[G]ove so s[D]low.
And tell her [Emi]how I'm still alive
and how I [Cadd9]wish I was something I could b[G]oast.
'Cause I'm [Emi]up in the sky now
and the [Cadd9]stars have never seemed this cl[G]ose.

Chorus:
[Cadd9]Tell her I'm l[G]ost,
but that's alr[D]ight,
'cause after tw[Emi]enty-something ye[D]ars, I can b[Cadd9]arely walk the l[G]ine.
Only mes[Emi]sengers can t[D]ell her how I'm m[Cadd9]issing her to[G]night.

Outro:
[G]So if you're searching for love,

she's right down the road.
She'll be s[Cadd9]itting on a swing in the sun
making stones turn to g[G]old.
