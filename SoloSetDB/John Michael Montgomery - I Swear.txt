Intro:
[C][Am][Em7][F]

Verse:
[C]I see the [F]questions [Em7]in your [C]eyes
I know what's wei[F]ghin [G]on your [Am]mind
But you can be [F]sure I know my [G7sus]part[G7]
Cause [C]I'll stand beside [F]you [Em7]through the [C]years
You'll only [F]cry those [G]happy [Am]tears
And though I'll [C/G]make mistakes
[D7/F#]I'll never break your [G7sus]heart[G]

Chorus:
I [C]swear by the [Am]moon and the stars
in the [Em7]sky I'll be [F]there[G]
I [C]swear like the [Am]shadow that's by your [Em]sid[(G?)]e
I'll be [F]there[G]
For [Dm7]better or worse
Til [F]death do us [G]part
I'll [Dm7]love you with every [F]beat of my [G]heart
I [C]swear

Verse:
[C]I'll give you [F]every[Em7]thing I [C]can
[C]I'll build your [F]dreams with [G]these two [Am]hands
We'll hang some mem[F]ories on the [G7sus]walls[G7]
And [C]when, there's [F]silver [Em7]in your [C]hair
you won't have to [F]ask if [G]I still [Am]care
Cause as time [C/G]turns the page
[D7/F#]My love won't age at [G7sus]all[G]

Chorus:
I [C]swear by the [Am]moon and the stars
in the [Em7]sky I'll be [F]there
[G]I [C]swear, like the [Am]shadow that's by your [Em]sid[(G?)]e
I'll be [F]there[G]
For [Dm7]better or worse
Til [F]death do us [G]part
I'll [Dm7]love you with every [F]beat of my [G]heart
I [C]swear
