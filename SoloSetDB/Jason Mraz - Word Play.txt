Intro:
[G][Cadd9][Dsus4]
[G][Cadd9][Dsus4]

Verse:
[Em7][Dsus4][Cadd9]

[Em7]I've been all around the world
[Dsus4]I've been a new sensation
[Cadd9]But it doesn't really matter
In this generation
[Em7]The sophomore slump is an uphill battle[Dsus4]
[Cadd9]And someone said that ain't my scene
[Em7]'Cause they need a new song
[Dsus4]Like a new religion
Music for the television
[Cadd9]I can't do the long division
Someone do the math
[Em7]For the record label puts me on the shelf up in th[Dsus4]e freezer
[Cadd9]Got to find another way to live the life of leisure
[Em7]So I drop my top
[Dsus4]Mix and I mingle
[Cadd9]Is everybody ready for the single and it goes...

Chorus:
[G][Cadd9][Dsus4]

[G]Ha La La[Cadd9] La La[Dsus4]
Now listen closely to the verse I lay

[G](Ha La La[Cadd9] La La[Dsus4])
It's all about the wordplay
[G](Ha La La[Cadd9] La Lo[Dsus4]ve)
The wonderful thing it does
[G]Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la[Cadd9]-la's
[Dsus4]Yeah the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

Verse:
(same chords as in verse 1)
[Em7]And it's time to get ill I got your remedy
[Dsus4]For those who don't remember me
[Cadd9]Well let me introduce you to my style
[Em7]I try to keep a jumble
[Cadd9]And the lyrics never mumble

[Em7]When the music's makin' people tongue-tied
[Dsus4]You want a new song
[Cadd9]Like a new religion
[Em7]Music for the television
[Cadd9]Em7
I can't do the long division
[Dsus4]Someone do the math
[Cadd9]For the people write me off like I'm a one-hit wonder
[Em7]Gota find another way to keep from goin' under
[Cadd9]Pull out the stops
[Em7]Got your attention
[Dsus4]I guess it's time again for me to mention
[Cadd9]The wordplay

Chorus:
[G][Cadd9][Dsus4]

[G]Ha La La[Cadd9] La La[Dsus4]
Now listen closely to the verse I lay
[G](Ha La La[Cadd9] La La[Dsus4])
It's all about the wordplay
[G](Ha La La[Cadd9] La Lo[Dsus4]ve)
The wonderful thing it does
[G]Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la[Cadd9]-la's
[Dsus4]Yeah the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay

Bridge:
Cadd9 (1 strum)
I built a bridge across the stream my consciousness
It always seems to be a flowin'
But I don't know which way my brain is goin'
Oh the ryhm[G]in' and the timin'
K[Dsus4]eeps the melodies inside me
[Cadd9]And they're comin'
Till I'm running out of air
Are you prepare[Asus4]d to take a dive into the deep end of my head
[Cadd9]Are you listening to a single word I've said

Chorus:
[G][Cadd9][Dsus4]

[G]Ha La La[Cadd9] La La[Dsus4]
Now listen closely to the verse I lay
[G](Ha La La[Cadd9] La La[Dsus4])
It's all about the wordplay
[G](Ha La La[Cadd9] La Lo[Dsus4]ve)
The wonderful thing it does
[G]Because, because
I am the wizard of ooh's and ah's and fa-la[Cadd9]-la's
[Dsus4]Yeah the Mister A to Z
They say I'm all about the wordplay
