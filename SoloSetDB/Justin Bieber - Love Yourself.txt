Verse:
For all the [E]times that you rained[B] on my pa[C#m]rade
And all the [F#m]clubs you get in [E]using my na[B]me
You think you [E]broke my heart, oh, [B]girl for goodness'[C#m]sake
You think I'm [F#m]crying on my [E]own. Well, I ain't[B]
And I didn't wanna [E]write a song[B]
'Cause I didn't want [C#m]anyone thinking I still care. I [F#m]don't,
But [E]you still hit my [B]phone up
And, baby, I'll be [E]moving on[B]
And I think you [C#m]should be somethin' I don't wanna [F#m]hold back,
[E]Maybe you should [B]know that

Pre-Chorus:
My mama don't [C#m]like you [A]and she likes everyone[E]
And I never [C#m]like to [A]admit that I was wrong[E]
And I've been so [C#m]caught up in [A]my job,
Didn't [E]see what's going on
But now I [C#m]know,[A]
I'm better [B]sleeping on my own

Chorus:
'Cause if you [E]like the way[B] you [C#m]look that much
[A]Oh, baby, [E]you should go and love [A]yourself[E]
And if you [E]think that I'm[B] still [C#m]holdin' on [A]to somethin'
[E]You should go and love yourself

Verse:
And when you [E]told me that you [B]hated my [C#m]friends
The only [F#m]problem was with [E]you and not them[B]
And every [E]time you told me [B]my opinion was[C#m]wrong
And tried to [F#m]make me forget [E]where I came from[B]
And I didn't wanna [E]write a song[B]
'Cause I did n't want [C#m]anyone thinking I still care. I [F#m]don't,
But [E]you still hit my [B]phone up
And, baby, I be [E]movin' on[B]
And I think you [C#m]should be somethin' I don't wanna [F#m]hold back,
[E]Maybe you should [B]know that

Pre-Chorus:
My mama don't [C#m]like you [A]and she likes everyone[E]
And I never [C#m]like to [A]admit that I was wrong[E]
And I've been so [C#m]caught up in [A]my job,
Didn't [E]see what's going on
But now I [C#m]know,[A]
I'm better [B]sleeping on my own

Chorus:
'Cause if you [E]like the way[B] you [C#m]look that much
[A]Oh, baby, [E]you should go and love [A]yourself[E]
And if you [E]think that I'm[B] still [C#m]holdin' on [A]to somethin'
[E]You should go and love yourself

Verse:
For all the [E]times that you [B]made me feel [C#m]small
I fell in [F#m]love. Now I feel [E]nothin' at all[B]
And never [E]felt so low when [B]I was vulne[C#m]rable
Was I a [F#m]fool to let you [E]break down my walls?[B]

Outro - Chorus:
'Cause if you [E]like the way[B] you [C#m]look that much
[A]Oh, baby, [E]you should go and love [A]yourself[E]
And if you [E]think that I'm[B] still [C#m]holdin' on [A]to somethin'
[E]You should go and love [A]yourself[E]
'Cause if you [E]like the way[B] you [C#m]look that much
[A]Oh, baby, [E]you should go and love [A]yourself[E]
And if you [E]think that I'm[B] still [C#m]holdin' on [A]to somethin'
[E]You should go and love [A]yourself[E]
