Verse:
[D]Well, the midnight headlight blind you on a rainy night,
steep grade up ahead, slow me down, makin' no [G]time.
I gotta keep [D]rollin'.
[D]Those windshield wipers slappin' out a tempo, keepin'
perfect rhythm with the song on the radi..[G]o.
Gotta keep [D]rollin'.

Chorus:
[D]Ooooooo, I'm driving my [C]life away..lookin' for a [G]better way,
for [D]me.
[D]Ooooooo, I'm driving my [C]life away..lookin' for a [G]sunny day.[Bm][G][D7]

[D]Well, the truck stop cutie, comin' on to me, tried to talk
me into a ride..said I wouldnt be [G]sorry.
But she was just a [D]ba..by.

shoot me out, flyin' down the [G]highway..lookin' for the [D]morn..ing.
