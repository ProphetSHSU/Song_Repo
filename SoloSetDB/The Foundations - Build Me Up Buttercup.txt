Intro:

[C][E7][F][G]

Chorus:
Why do you [C]build me up (build me up) [E7]Buttercup, baby
Just to [F]let me down (let me down) and [G]mess me around
And then [C]worst of all (worst of all) [E7]you never call, baby
When you [F]say you will (say you will) but [G]I love you still
I need [C]you (I need you) more than [C7]anyone, darlin'
You [F]know that I have from the [Fm]start
So [C]build me up [G]Buttercup,
Don't break my [F]hear[C]t [G][C]

Verse:
"I'll be o[C]ver at t[G]en," you told me [Bb]time and [F]again
But you're la[C]te, I wait [F]around and then
I [C]went to the [G]door, I can't [Bb]take any [F]more
It's not [C]you, you let me [F]down again

Pre-Chorus:
([F]Hey, [C]hey, [Dm]hey!) Baby, baby, try to find
([G]Hey, [Fm]hey, [Em]hey!) A little time and I'll make you mine
I[F]'ll be home
I'll be [D7]beside the phone waiting for yo[G]u
O[G]oo-oo-ooo, [G]ooo-oo-ooo

Verse:
To [C]you I'm a [G]toy but I [Bb]could be the [F]boy you
A[C]dore, if you'd just l[F]et me know
Alt[C]hough you're [G]untrue,
I'm [Bb]attracted to [F]you all the [C]more
Why do I [F]need you so

Pre-Chorus:
([F]Hey, [C]hey, [Dm]hey!) Baby, baby, try to find
