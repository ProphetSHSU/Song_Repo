Verse:
It takes a crane to build [F#m]a crane
It takes two floors to [Bm]make a story
It takes an egg to make a [D]hen
It takes a hen to make an [Dm]egg
There is no end to what I'm [A]saying[E]

It takes a thought to m[F#m]ake a word
And it takes some words to [Bm]make an action
It takes some work to make it [D]work
It takes some good to make it [Dm]hurt
It takes some bad for sat[A]isfaction[E]

Chorus:
[F#m]La la la la la la la [Bm]life is wonderful
[E]Ah la la la la la la [A]life goes [E]full circle
[F#m]Ah la la la la la la [Bm]life is wonderful
[E]Al la la la la

Interlude:
[F#m][F#m][F#m][F#m]

Verse:
It takes a night to make [F#m]it dawn
And it takes a day to make you [Bm]yawn brother
And it takes some old to make you [D]young
It takes some cold to know the [Dm]sun
It takes the one to have[A] the other[E]

And it takes no time to fall in [F#m]love
But it takes you years to [Bm]know what love is
It takes some fears to make you [D]trust
It takes those tears to make it [Dm]rust
It takes the dust to have it [A]polished[E]

Chorus:
[F#m]La la la la la la la [Bm]life is wonderful
[E]Ah la la la la la la [A]life goes [E]full circle
[F#m]Ah la la la la la la [Bm]life is wonderful
[E]Al la la la la

Verse:
It takes some silence to make [F#m]sound
It takes a loss before you [Bm]found it
And it takes a road to go no[D]where
It takes a toll to make you [Dm]care
It takes a hole to make a [A]mountain[E]

Chorus:
[F#m]Ah la la la la la la [Bm]life is wonderful
[E]Ah la la la la la la [A]life goes [E]full circle
[F#m]Ha la la la la la [Bm]life is wonderful
[E]Ha la la la la la [A]life is [E]meaningful
[F#m]Ha la la la la la [Bm]life is wonderful
[E]Ha la la la la la [A]life it is...[E]so... wonderful
[F#m]It is so meaningful
It is so wonderful
It is meaningful
It is wonderful
It is meaningful
It goes full circle
Wonderful
Meaningful
Full circle
Wonderful
