Verse:
[F]Right 'round the [C]corner  [G]  down by the [C]canyon
[F]  I met a [C]man who lost his [G]way
[F]  Said "I’m[C] Saul, bo[G]rn the son[C]of a sailor
[F]  Who never [C]showed me his f[G]ace
[F]  My daddy’s [C]gone and my [G]momma met her m[C]aker
[F]  Oh to [C]hell with that [G]place"

Pre-Chorus 1:

So I said [F]"Quit your[C] talking, your[F] sideways[C]walking
[F]Time to find a[C]nother path to t[G]ake
[F]Quit your [C]whining your [F]blood-shot[C]crying
[F]Faking like you'r[C]e dying neve[G]r pays"

Chorus 1:

Just go [G]ho----me
You need you some [F]home[C][G]
Oh y[C]ou need you so[F]me home[C][G]

Verse:
Her [F]name was Peggy [C]Sue and her [G]Daddy hung the moo[C]n
[F]In her eyes [C]he could no wro[G]ng
But [F]then he started [C]drinking like there’s a [G]me[(one]ssage[strum] in th[down)]e bottle
Now [F]Daddy’s painting [C]Peggy black and [G]blue

Pre-Chorus 2:

She [F]closes her [C]eyes
Through the [F]hero's dem[C]ise
[F]Holds to a [C]hope beyond the [G]sky
She [F]takes a [C]breath
[F]Weight comes off her ch[C]est
She [F]finds a way to [C]weather through the [G]storm

Chorus 2:

[G]She cried out "Ho----me
I need me some [F]home[C][G]
Oh I [C]need me some [F]home"[C][G]

Verse:
[F]  I found my[C]self on a [G]train to Cali[C]fornia
[F]  At twenty-[C]five years of [G]age
[F]  Sat be[C]side me was a [G]lo[(one]vely [strum]rose, [down)]a wanderer
[F] Two's alw[C]ays better they [G]say

Pre-Chorus 3:

So we [F]made our [C]plans
She [F]gave me her [C]hand
[F]We ain’t got no [C]time for looking [G]back
I was [F]bruised and [C]beaten
[F]Lost for many [C]reasons
[F]Only love would[C] make you unde[G]rstand

Chorus 3:

[G]Ho----me
I love me some [F]home[C][G]
I [C]love me some [F]home[C][G]
Yeah I love me some [F]home[C][G][C]
[F][C][G]

Ending:

We're [F]all bruised and [C]beaten
Lost o[F]n account of many [C]reasons
But [F]only love will [C]make you under[G]stand
[G]Ho---[N.C.]---me I love me some home[F][C][G]
Oh I [C]love me some [F]home[C][G]
Yeah I love me some [F]home[C][G]
Oh I [C]love me some [F]home[C][G]
Love me some home![C][G][C]
