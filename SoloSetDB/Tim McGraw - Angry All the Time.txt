Intro: 
[A D E A]

Verse:
[A]Here we are
What is left of a [D]husband and a wife
With [E]four good kids Who have a way of [A]getting on with their lives
I'm not old but I'm getting a whole lot [D]older every day
It's [E]too late to keep from goin' crazy
[A]I've got to get away

Chorus:
The reasons that [D]I can't stay don't have a thing to [A]do with being in love
And I [E]understand that loving a man shouldn't [A]have to be this rough
You ain't the [D]only one Who feels like this world [A]left you far behind
I don't know [D]why you gotta be Angry All The [E]Time

Verse:
[A]Our boys are strong now, the spitting image of[D]you when you were young
I hope [E]someday they can see past [D]what you have become
[A]I remember every time I [D]said I'd never leave
What [E]I can't live with is memories of the [A]way you used to be

Chorus:
The reasons that [D]I can't stay don't have a thing to [A]do with being in love
And I [E]understand that loving a man shouldn't [A]have to be this rough
You ain't the [D]only one Who feels like this world [A]left you far behind
I don't know [D]why you gotta be Angry All The [E]Time

Solo:
[A][D][E][A]

Verse:
[A]Twenty years have came and went since I [D]walked out of your door
I [E]never quite made it back to the [A]one I was before
[A]And God it hurts me to think of you before the [D]light in your eyes was gone
I don't [E]know why this old world can't leave [A]well enough alone

Chorus:
The reasons that [D]I can't stay don't have a thing to [A]do with being in love
And I [E]understand that loving a man shouldn't [A]have to be this rough
You ain't the [D]only one Who feels like this world [A]left you far behind
I don't know [D]why you gotta be Angry All The [E]Time
