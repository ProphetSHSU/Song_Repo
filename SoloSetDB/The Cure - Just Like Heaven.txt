Verse:
"[G]Show me how you [D]do that trick
The [Am]one that makes m[C]e scream" she said
"The [G]one that makes me [D]laugh" she said
And [Am]threw her arms[C]around my neck
"[G]Show me how you [D]do it
And I [Am]promise you [C]I promise that
I'll run aw[G]ay with you[D]
I'll run a[Am]way with you"[C]

Instrumental:
[G][D][Am][C]
[G][D][Am][C]

Verse:
[G]Spinning on that [D]dizzy edge
I [Am]kissed her face an[C]d kissed her head
And [G]dreamed of all the d[D]ifferent ways I [Am]had
To make her [C]glow
[G]"Why are you so [D]far away?" she s[Am]aid
"Why won't you [C]ever know that I'm in [G]love with you[D]
That I'm in [Am]love with you[C]"

Chorus:
[Em]You
[F]Soft and only
[Em]You
[F]Lost and lonely
[Em]You
[F]Strange as angels
[C]Dancing in the deepest oceans

Twisting in the water

You're just like a dream

Instrumental:
[G][D][Am][C]
[G][D][Am][C]

Verse:
[G]Daylight licked me [D]into shape
I [Am]must have been [C]asleep for days
And [G]moving lips to [D]breathe her name
I [Am]opened up m[C]y eyes
And [G]found myself a[D]lone alone
A[Am]lone above [C]a raging sea
That [G]stole the only [D]girl I loved
And [Am]drowned her deep [C]inside of me

Chorus:
[Em]You
[F]Soft and only
[Em]You
[F]Lost and lonely
[Em]You
[F]Just like heaven[C]
