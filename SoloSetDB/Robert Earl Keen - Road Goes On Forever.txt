S[D]herry was a waitress at th[D]e only joint in town
S[G]he had a reputation as a[G]girl who'd been around
Down M[D]ain Street after midnight, [D]a brand new pack of cigs
A fr[G]esh one hanging from her lips,[G]a beer between her legs
She'd r[A]ide down to the river,[A]meet with all her friends
The ro[G]ad goes on forever and th[G]e party never Ends
[D]
 
 
Sonny was a loner, older than the rest
He was goin' in the Navy, but he couldn't pass the test
So he hung around town, sold a little pot
The Law caught wind of Sonny, one day he got caught
He was back in business when they set him free again
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

 
 
Sonny's playing eight ball at the joint where Sherry works
When some drunkin' out of towner put his hands up Sherry's skirt
Sonny took his pool cue, lay the drunk out on the floor
Stuck a dollar in her tip jar, and walked on out the door
She's running right beside him, reaching for his hand
The road goes on forever and the party never ends

 
 
They jump into his pickup, Sonny jammed her into gear
He looked on over at Sherry and said, "Let's get on out of here”
The stars were high above them, the moon was in the East
The sun was setting on them when they reached Miami Beach
They got a hotel by the water, a quart of Bombay gin
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
 
 

They soon ran out of money, but Sonny knew a man
Who knew some Cuban refugees who dealt in contraband
Sonny met the Cubans at a house just off the route
With a briefcase full of money and a pistol in his boot
The cards were on the table when the Law came bustin' in
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
 
 

The Cubans grabbed the goodies, Sonny grabbed the jack
Broke the bathroom window and crawled on out the back
Sherry had drove the pickup through the alley on the side
Where a lawman tackled Sonny and was reading him his rights
Sherry stepped in the alley with a single shot .410
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
 
 

They left the lawman lying, they made their getaway
Got back to the hotel just before the break of day
Sonny gave her all the money, and he blew a little kiss
If they ask you how this happened say I forced you into this
She watched as his taillights disappeared around the bend
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
 
 

It's Main Street after midnight, just like it was before
Twenty one months later at the local grocery store
Sherry buys a paper, a cold six pack of beer
Headlines read that Sonny's goin' to the chair
She drives out onto Main Street in her new Mercedes Benz
The road goes on forever and the party never ends
