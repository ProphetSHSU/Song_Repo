Verse 1:
[E]Sheets of empty [Asus2]canvas, 
untouched [E]sheets of clay[Asus2]
Were [E]laid spread out be[A]fore me 
as her [E]body once did

[E]All five hor[Asus2]izons revolved 
[E]around her soul [Asus2]as the earth to the sun
[E]Now the air I [A]tasted and breathed 
has [E]taken a turn

Pre-chorus 1:
[C]Oh, and all I taught her was 
everythi[Em]ng
[C]Oh, I know she gave me 
all that she [Em]wore

Chorus:
And now my [D]bitter hands,
Chafe be[C]neath the clouds
Of what was [Em]everything
All the [D]pictures have
All been w[C]ashed in black
Tattooed everyt[Em]hing

Verse 2:
[E]I take a [Asus2]walk outside, 
I'm sur[E]rounded by some [Asus2]kids at play
[E]I can feel their [A]laughter, 
so [E]why do I sear

Pre-chorus 2:
[C]Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin 
'round my[Em] head, I'm spinning, oh
I'm [C]spinning, 
how quick the sun can drop a[Em]way

Chorus:
And now my [D]bitter hands
Cradle [C]broken glass
Of what was ever[Em]ything
All the [D]pictures have
All been w[C]ashed in black
Tattooed ever[Em]ything
All the [D]love gone bad
Turned my [C]world to black
And tattooed all [D]I see,
All that [C]I am,
All that I'll [Em]be

Bridge:
[D]  [C]Yeah  [Em]Uh huh  [D]Uh huh  [C]Uh
I [Em]know someday you'll have a beautiful life,
I [D]know you'll be a star 
in so[C]mebody else's sky
But [Em]why, why, [D]why can't it [C]be,
[C]Oh can't it be mi[Em]ne[C[D]]
[Em]ooh, ah [D]yeah, aah[C] ooh
[C](Doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo[Em])
[Em](Doodoo-doo-doo-doodoodoo[D])
