Intro:
[G][C/G][G][C/G]

Verse:
Ring the b[G]ells!
This time I mean it
Bid the h[G]atred "fair thee well"
Give back the p[G]ieces of my Jesus
Take your [G]counterfeit to hell![Gsus]

Bang the dr[G]ums!
This means war
But not the k[G]ind you're waiting for
We say [G]mercy won't be rationed here
That's [G]what we're fighting for

Pre-Chorus 1:

[C]All is fair in love and war
And [C]what the hell is loving even f[G]or?
If [C]we can't sing it loud enough
We'll [C]keep on adding voices up[C]
Chorus:
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]

Verse:
Move your f[G]eet
You tiny people
You've been h[G]iding for so long
Behind your st[G]atues and your steeples
Does that h[G]it too close to home?[Gsus]

I got f[G]aith to move a mountain
And to w[G]atch that mountain move
It's time for w[G]ords to fall like thunder
Sound of [G]justice breaking through

Pre-Chorus 2:

If [C]all is fair in love and war
Then [C]what the hell is loving even f[G]or?
The [C]world laughs and the martyrs sing
But [C]love breaks through the cavalry[C]

Chorus:
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]

Verse:
[N.C.]You called me boy instead of son
[N.C.]And I ain't the only one
[N.C.]Was in the throneroom of a kingdom
Where I found that I belong[G][Gsus]

I ain't [G]scared to face a fortress
I have [G]seen them fall before
With br[G]oken bones you've built it
But it [G]crumbles board by board[Gsus]
Pre-Chorus 3:
If [C]all is fair in love and war
Then [C]what the hell is loving even f[G]or?
If [C]we can't sing it loud enough
We'll [C]keep on adding voices up[C]

Chorus:
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]
Ring the b[G]ells[Gsus]

Outro:
Ring the b[G]ells!
This time I mean it
Bid the h[G]atred "fair thee well"
Give back the p[G]ieces of my Jesus
[N.C.]Take your counterfeit to hell!
