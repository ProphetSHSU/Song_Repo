Intro:
[F] [C][G][Am]

Chorus:
Don't tell me this is all [F]for not[C]hin'
I can only tell you [G]one t[Am]hing
On the nights you feel [F]outnumb[C]ered
Baby, I'll be out there [G]somewhere[Am]
I see everything you [F]can be[C]
I see the beauty that you [G]can't se[Am]e
On the nights you feel [F]outnumb[C]ered
Baby, I'll be out there [G]somewhere[Am]

Verse:
[F] I could've showed you [C]all the scars at the start
 But that was [G]always the most difficult [Am]part
 See I'm in [F]love with how your soul's a [C]mix of chaos and art
 And how you [G]never try to keep 'em a[Am]part (Yeah)
[F] I wrote some words and [C]then I stared at my feet
 Became a [G]coward when I needed to [Am]speak
 I guess [F]love took on a different [C]kind of meaning for me
 So when I [G]go, just know it kills me to [Am]leave

Pre-Chorus:
[F]  To all the [C]stars that light the road
[G]  Don't ever [Am]leave that girl so cold
[F]  Never let me [C]down, just lead me home[G][Am]

Chorus:
Don't tell me this is all [F]for not[C]hin'
I can only tell you [G]one t[Am]hing
On the nights you feel [F]outnumb[C]ered
Baby, I'll be out there [G]somewhere[Am]
I see everything you [F]can be[C]
I see the beauty that you [G]can't se[Am]e
On the nights you feel [F]outnumb[C]ered
Baby, I'll be out there [G]somewhere[Am]

[F][C][G][Am]

Verse:
[F] But there's beauty [C]here that's yet to depart
 There's still a [G]song inside the halls in the [Am]dark (Halls in the dark)
[F] I'll come for you if [C]you just stay where you are
 And I'll [G]always hold your hand in the [Am]car (Hand in the car)
[F] There'll be days when it's [C]difficult
 But I ask you to [G]never leave behind the re[Am]ciprocal, we're past that
 [F]Love is not designed for the [C]cynical
 So we have that[G]
 We can h[Am]ave that

Pre-Chorus:
[F]  To all the [C]stars that light the road
[G]  Don't ever [Am]leave that girl so cold
[F]  Never let me [C]down, just lead me home[G][Am]

Chorus:
Don't tell me this is all [F]for not[C]hin'
I can only tell you [G]one t[Am]hing
On the nights you feel [F]outnumb[C]ered
Baby, I'll be out there [G]somewhere[Am]
I see everything you [F]can be[C]
I see the beauty that you [G]can't se[Am]e
On the nights you feel [F]outnumb[C]ered
Baby, I'll be out there [G]somewhere[Am]

Bridge:
[F] Ho[C]w long[G] can you wait[Am]for the one you deserve?
[F] Fig[C]ht on[G], never let it[Am]out, never let it out
[F] If [C]I'm gone,[G] if you ever leave I [Am]hope that you learn
[F]To fi[C]ght on, to f[G]ight on[Am]

Chorus:
Don't tell me this is all [F]for not[C]hin'
I can only tell you [G]one t[Am]hing
On the nights you feel [F]outnumb[C]ered
Baby, I'll be out there [G]somewhere[Am]
I see everything you [F]can be[C]
I see the beauty that you [G]can't se[Am]e
On the nights you feel [F]outnumb[C]ered
Baby, I'll be out there [G]somewhere[Am]

Outro:
[F] (H[C]ow long?)
 Baby, I'll be out there [G]somewhere, somewhere, [Am]somewhere
[F] (H[C]ow long?)
 Baby, I'll be out there [G]somewhere, [Am]somewhere
