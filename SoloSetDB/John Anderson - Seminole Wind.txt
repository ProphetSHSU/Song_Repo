Verse:
[Em] Ever since the d[G]ays of old m[D]en would search for we[A]alth untold
[Em] They'd dig for silver [G]and for gold and l[D]eave the empty h[A]oles
 And [Em]way down south in the [G]Everglades
 Where the bl[D]ack water rolls and the s[A]aw grass waves
[Em] The eagles fly and the [G]otters play in the l[D]and of the Seminol[A]e

Chorus:
 So b[Em]low, blow S[G]eminole wind bl[D]ow like you're never gonna bl[A]ow again
[Em] I'm callin' to you like a l[G]ong-lost friend but [D]I know who you [A]are
 And b[Em]low, blow from the [G]Okeechobee [D]all the way up to M[A]icanopy
 Bl[Em]ow across the home of the S[G]eminole the [D]alligators and the g[A]ar

Interlude:

Verse:
 P[Em]rogress came and t[G]ook its toll and [D]in the name of fl[A]ood control
[Em] They made their plans and they dr[G]ained the land
 Now the Gl[D]ades are goin' dr[A]y
 And the l[Em]ast time I walked [G]in the swamp I st[D]ood up on a c[A]ypruss stump
[Em] I listened close and I h[G]eard the ghost of [D]Oseola cry[A]

Chorus:
 So b[Em]low, blow S[G]eminole wind bl[D]ow like you're never gonna bl[A]ow again
[Em] I'm callin' to you like a l[G]ong-lost friend but [D]I know who you [A]are
 And b[Em]low, blow from the [G]Okeechobee [D]all the way up to M[A]icanopy
 Bl[Em]ow across the home of the S[G]eminole the [D]alligators and the g[A]ar
