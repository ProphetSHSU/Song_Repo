Verse:
[G]It's amaz[D]ing how y[Cadd9]ou can speak rig[D]ht to my hea[G]rt[D][Cadd9][D]
[G]Without sa[D]ying a wo[Cadd9]rd, you can ligh[D]t up the dar[G]k [D][Cadd9][D]
[Cadd9]Try as I may, I can ne[D]ver explain
[G]What I he[D]ar when you do[Cadd9]n't say a thin[D]g

Chorus:
Th[G]e smile on your [D]face lets me [Cadd9]know that you [D]need me
There's a [G]truth in your e[D]yes saying y[Cadd9]ou'll never
[D]leave me
The [G]touch of[D] your hand says you'[Cadd9]ll catch me where
ever I [D]fall
[Cadd9]You say it best[Cadd9],  when [D]you say nothing at all [G][D][Cadd9][D]

Verse:
[G]All day l[D]ong I can[Cadd9] hear people tal[D]king out lou[G]d [D][Cadd9][D]
[G]But when yo[D]u hold me [Cadd9]near, you drow[D]n out the cr[G]owd [D][Cadd9][D]
[Cadd9]Try as they may, they c[D]an never define
[G]What's been sa[D]id between y[Cadd9]our heart and [D]mine

Chorus:
Th[G]e smile on your [D]face lets me [Cadd9]know that you [D]need me
There's a [G]truth in your e[D]yes saying y[Cadd9]ou'll never
[D]leave me
The [G]touch of[D] your hand says you'[Cadd9]ll catch me where
ever I [D]fall
[Cadd9]You say it best[Cadd],  when[D]you say nothing at all
