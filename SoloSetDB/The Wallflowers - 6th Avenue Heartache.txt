Verse 1:
[Bb]  Sirens [F]ring, the shots ring out[C]

I held my [Gm]hands, never knew[Bb]  how to act

On the steps alone,[F] his guitar in[C] hand
It's fifty [Gm]years, stood where he stands[Bb]

Was [C]drawn on me
And now it's drawn me in[Gm]

Verse 3:
The river [Gm]winds move my [Bb]feet
Subway [F]steam, like silhouettes in [C]dreams
They stood by [Gm]me, just like moon[Bb]beams

Was [C]drawn on me
And now it's drawn me in[Gm]

Bridge:
[Bb]  Look out the [F]window, down upon that [C]street
And gone like a [Gm]midnight where was that[Bb]  man
But I see his [F]six strings laid against that [C]wall
And all his [Gm]things, they all look so[Bb]  small
I got my fingers [F]crossed on a shooting[C] star
Just like [Gm]me just moved[Bb]  on

Chorus:
And the same[F] black line that was drawn on you
Was [C]drawn on me
And now it's drawn me in[Gm]

Was [C]drawn on me
And now it's drawn me in[Gm]
6th Avenue [Bb]heartache
