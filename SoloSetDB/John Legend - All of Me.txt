Intro:
[Em][C][G][D]
[Em][C][G][D]

Verse:
[Em]What would I [Cmaj7]do without your smart m[G]outh
Drawing me [D]in, and you kicking me [Em]out
Got my hea[C]d spinning, n[G]o kidding, I can[D]'t pin you [Em]down
What's going [Cmaj7]on in that beautiful m[G]ind
I'm on your magi[D]cal mystery ri[Em]de
And I'm [Cadd9]so   dizzy, don't [G]know what hit me, but [D]I'll be al[Amadd9]right

Pre-Chorus A:
My [Am]head's under wa[G]ter
But [D]I'm breathing f[Amadd9]ine
You're crazy and [G]I'm out of my m[D]ind

Chorus:
Cause a[G]ll of me
Loves a[Emadd9]ll of you
Love your [Am/C]curves and all your edges
All your pe[C/D]rfect imper[D]fections
Give your a[G]ll to me
I'll give my [Emadd9]all to you
You're my [Am/C]end and my beginning
Even [C/D]when I lose I'm [D]winning
Cause I give you a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of m[G]e[Dadd9]
And you give me a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of y[G]ou, o[Dadd9]h

Verse:
[Em]How many [C]times do I have to tell [G]you
Even when you're [D]crying you’re beautiful [Em]too
The world is b[C]eating you d[G]own, I'm ar[D]ound through every [Em]mood
You're my dow[C]nfall, you're my m[G]use
My worst dist[D]raction, my rhythm and bl[Em]ues
I can't stop sin[C]ging, it's rin[G]ging, in [D]my head for y[Am]ou

Pre-Chorus A:
My [Am]head's under wa[G]ter
But [D]I'm breathing f[Amadd9]ine
You're crazy and [G]I'm out of my m[D]ind

Chorus:
Cause a[G]ll of me
Loves a[Emadd9]ll of you
Love your [Am/C]curves and all your edges
All your pe[C/D]rfect imper[D]fections
Give your a[G]ll to me
I'll give my [Emadd9]all to you
You're my [Am/C]end and my beginning
Even [C/D]when I lose I'm [D]winning
Cause I give you a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of m[G]e[Dadd9]
And you give me a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of y[G]ou, o[Dadd9]h

Pre-Chorus B:
[Am]Cards on th[G]e table
We're b[D]oth showing he[Amadd9]arts
[Am]Risking i[G]t all, though it'[D]s hard

Chorus:
Cause a[G]ll of me
Loves a[Emadd9]ll of you
Love your [Am/C]curves and all your edges
All your pe[C/D]rfect imper[D]fections
Give your a[G]ll to me
I'll give my [Emadd9]all to you
You're my [Am/C]end and my beginning
Even [C/D]when I lose I'm [D]winning
Cause I give you a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of m[G]e[Dadd9]
And you give me a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of y[G]ou[Dadd9]

Outro:
I give you a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of m[G]e[D]
And you give me a[Em]ll, a[C]ll of y[G]ou, o[D]h
