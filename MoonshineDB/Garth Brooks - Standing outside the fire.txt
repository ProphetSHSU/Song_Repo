Intro:
[G][C/G][G][C/G]

Verse:
We call them co[G]ol
Those hearts that [C/G]have no scars to sh[G]ow
The ones that n[Em]ever do let [C]go
And risk the t[Am]ables being tur[D]ned  [D/C]      [D/B]      [D/A]

We call them fo[G]ols
Who have to da[C]nce within the fl[G]ame
Who chance the so[Em]rrow and the sh[C]ame
That always c[Am]omes with getting bu[D]rned[D/C][D/B][D/A]

Bridge:
But you've [Em]got to be t[D/F#]ough
When cons[C]umed by d[G]esire[G/F#]
Cause [Em]it's not e[D/F#]nough just to st[C]and [C/B]outsi[D]de the f[G]ire[G]

Verse:
We call them str[G]ong
Those who can f[C]ace this world al[G]one
Who seem to [Em]get by on their o[C]wn
Those who will n[Am]ever take the f[D]all[D/C][D/B][D/A]

We call them we[G]ak
Who are una[C]ble to re[G]sist
The slightest ch[Em]ance love might ex[C]ist
And for t[Am]hat forsake it a[D]ll[D/C][D/B][D/A]

Pre-Chorus:
They're so [Em]hell bent on gi[D/F#]ving
[C]Walking a wi[G]re[G/F#]
Conv[Em]inced it's not l[D/F#]iving
When you st[C]and o[C/B]utsi[D]de the f[G]ire[G]

Chorus:
[C]Standing out[D]side the f[G]ire
[C]Standing out[D]side the f[G]ire
[Em]Life is not [D/F#]tried it is [G]mer[C5]ely[C/B] survi[C]ved
[C/B]If you're st[Am]anding out[D]side the f[G]ire

Bridge 2:
There's this l[C]ove that is burning
[G/B]Deep in my soul
[Am]Constantly yearning to get o[G]ut of control
[C]Wanting to fly
[G/B]Higher and higher
[Am]I can't [G/B]abide, s[C]tanding o[D]utside...the fire

Chorus:
[C]Standing out[D]side the f[G]ire
[C]Standing out[D]side the f[G]ire
[Em]Life is not [D/F#]tried it is [G]mer[C5]ely[C/B] survi[C]ved
[C/B]If you're st[Am]anding out[D]side the f[G]ire
