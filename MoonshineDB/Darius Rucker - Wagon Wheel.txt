Verse 1:
[A]Heading down south to the [E]land of the pines
I'm [F#m]thumbing my way into North[D]Caroline
[A]Staring up the road and [E]pray to God I see head[D]lights
I [A]made it down the coast in [E]seventeen hours
Pic[F#m]king me a bouquet of dog[D]wood flowers
And I'm a[A]hopin' for Raleigh, I can [E]see my baby tonight[D]

 
 
Chorus:
So rock[A] me momma like a [E]wagon wheel
[F#m]Rock me momma any [D]way you feel
Hey,[A]  [E] momma rock[D]me

Rock[F#m]   me momma like a [D]south bound train
Hey,[A]  [E] momma rock[D]me

Verse 2:
I'm [A]running from the cold [E]up in New England
I was [F#m]born to be a fiddler in an old[D]time string band
My [A]baby plays a guitar,[E] I pick a banjo now[D]

Oh, north[A] country winters keep a[E]getting me down
Lost my [F#m]money playing poker so I [D]had to leave town
But I ain't[A] turning back to [E]living that old life no[D]more

Caught a [F#m]trucker out of Philly had a [D]nice long toke
But [A]he's a heading west from the [E]Cumberland gap
To [D]Johnson City, Tennessee(eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee)

And I got[A]ta get a move on be[E]fore the sun
I hear my [F#m]baby calling my name and I [D]know that she's the only one
And [A]if I die in Raleigh at [E]least I will die[D]free
