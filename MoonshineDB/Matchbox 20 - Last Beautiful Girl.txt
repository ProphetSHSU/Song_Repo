Intro:
[D]

Verse:
[D]This will all fall [Bm]down

Like everything else that was
[D] This too shall [Bm]pass
And all of the words we [Em]said
We can't [A]take back[G]

Verse:
Now [D]every fool in [Bm]town
Would've left by [D]now
I can't re[Bm]place
All of the wasted [Em]days
The memory of your [A]face
I [G]can't help thinkin’

Pre-Chorus 1:
[Bm]Maybe if we ever coulda kept it all together
Where would [Em]we be?
A [Bm]thousand lost forevers
And the promises you never were [Em]givin' me
Here's [A]what I'm thinkin’:

Chorus:
It won't be the [D]first heart that [A]you break
It won't be the [Em]last, beauti[G]ful girl
The one that you [D]wrecked won't take [A]you back
If you were the [Em]last beauti[G]ful girl in the [D]world
(Last [A]beautiful [Em]girl)[G]

Verse:
So, [D]tell me one more [Bm]time

How you're sorry about
The [D]way this all went [Bm]down
You needed to find your [Em]space
You needed to still be [A]friends
You [G]needed me to

Pre-Chorus 2:
[Bm]Call you if I ever couldn't keep it all together
You'd [Em]comfort me
You'd [Bm]tell me 'bout forever
And the promises I never should [Em]have believed
Here's [A]what I'm thinkin’

Chorus:
It won't be the [D]first heart that [A]you break
It won't be the [Em]last, beauti[G]ful girl
The one that you [D]wrecked won't take [A]you back
If you were the [Em]last beauti[A]ful girl in the [D]world
(Last [F#7]beautiful [Bm]girl)
Last beautiful[G] girl in the [D]world
(Last [F#7]beautiful [Bm]girl)[G]

Bridge:
[D] It's over [F#7]now and I've gone with[Bm]out
'Cause you're [G]everyone else's [D]girl
It seems to [F#7]me you'll always[Bm]be
[G]Everyone else's [D]girl[F#7][Bm]
[G]Everyone else's [D]girl[F#7][Bm][G]

Verse:
[D]This will all fall [Bm]down
Like everything in the [D]world
This too must [Bm]end
And all of the words we [Em]said
We can't [A]take [G]back

Chorus:
It won't be the [D]first heart that [A]you break
It won't be the [Em]last, beauti[G]ful girl
The one that you [D]wrecked, won't take [A]you back
If you were the [Em]last beauti[G]ful girl
It won't be the [D]first heart that [A]you break
It won't be the [Em]last, beautif[G]ul girl
The one that you [D]wrecked, won't take [A]you back
If you were the [Em]last beauti[G]ful girl in the [D]world
(Last [F#7]beautiful [Bm]girl)
The last beauti[G]ful girl in the [D]world
(Last [F#7]beautiful girl)

Outro:
You are the [Bm]last beauti[G]ful girl
([D]Last [F#7]beautiful [Bm]girl)
Beauti[G]ful girl[D]
