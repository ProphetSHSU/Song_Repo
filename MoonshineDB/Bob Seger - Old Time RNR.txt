Intro:
[E][B]

[E]  [B]   Just take those old record[E]s off the shelf

Verse:
I'll sit and listen to 'em [A]by myself
Today's music ain't [B]got the same soul
I like that old time [E]rock 'n' roll
Don't try to take me to a [E]disco
You'll never even get me [A]out on the floor
In ten minutes I'll be [B]late for the door
I like that old time [E]rock 'n' roll
[B]  Still like that old time[E]rock 'n' roll

Chorus:
That kind of music just [A]soothes my soul
I reminisce about the [B]days of old
With that old time [E]rock 'n' rol[B]l

[B]  Won't go to hear 'em play a[E]tango

Verse:
I'd rather hear some blues or [A]funky old soul
There's only one sure way to [B]get me to go
Start playing old time [E]rock 'n' roll
Call me a relic, call me [E]what you will
Say I'm old fashioned, say I'm [A]over the hill
Today's music ain't [B]got the same soul
I like that old time [E]rock 'n' roll
[B]  Still like that old time[E]rock 'n' roll

Chorus:
That kind of music just [A]soothes the soul
I reminisce about the [B]days of old
With that old time [E]rock 'n' rol[B]l
