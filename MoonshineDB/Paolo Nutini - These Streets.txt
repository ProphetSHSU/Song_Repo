Verse:
C[C]ross the border[Em], int[F]o the big [G]bad world
W[C]here it takes you about an hour just to c[Em]ross the road,
Just to s[F]tumble across another p[G]oor old sole,
F[C]rom the dreary old lanes to the [Em]High St madness,
I[F] fight with my brain to bel[G]ieve my eyes
And i[C]t's harder than you think to b[Em]elieve this sadness,
It c[F]reeps up my spine and haunts me t[G]hrough the night

Pre-Chorus:
L[Am7]ife is good, and the girls are gorgeous,
S[F]uddenly the air smells much greener now
A[Am7]nd I'm walking around with a half pack of cigarettes
S[G]earching for the change I've lost somehow

Chorus:
T[C]hese Streets, have t[Em]oo many names for me
I[F]'m used to Glenfield Road and spending m[G]y time down in Orchy
I[C]'ll get used to this e[Em]ventually I [F]know, I [G]know

Verse:
W[C]here'd the d[Em]ays go [F]when all we did was [G]lay
A[C]nd the stress that we were under wasn't s[Em]tress at all,
J[F]ust a run and a jump into a h[G]armless fall
F[C]rom walking by a high-rise to a l[Em]andmark square,
You see m[F]illions of people with m[G]illions of cares
A[C]nd I stuggle to the train to make m[Em]y way home
I[F] look at the people as they s[G]it there alone

Pre-Chorus:
L[Am7]ife is good and the sun is shining,
E[F]verybody floats to their ideal place
A[Am7]nd the children all smile as the boats shuffle by them,
T[G]rying to pretend that they've got some space.

Chorus:
T[C]hese Streets, have t[Em]oo many names for me
I[F]'m used to Glenfield Road and spending m[G]y time down in Orchy
I[C]'ll get used to this e[Em]ventually I [F]know, I [G]know
[C]These Streets, have [Em]too many names for me
I[F]'m used to Glenfield Road and spending m[G]y time down in Orchy
I[C]'ll get used to this e[Em]ventually I [F]know, I [G]know

Pre-Chorus:
L[Am7]ife is good, and the girls are gorgeous,
S[F]uddenly the air smells much greener now
A[Am7]nd I'm walking around with a half pack of cigarettes
S[G]earching for the change I've lost somehow

Chorus:
T[C]hese Streets, have t[Em]oo many names for me
I[F]'m used to Glenfield Road and spending m[G]y time down in Orchy
I[C]'ll get used to this e[Em]ventually I [F]know, I [G]know

[C]These Streets, have [Em]too many names for me
I[F]'m used to Glenfield Road and spending m[G]y time down in Orchy
I[C]'ll get used to this e[Em]ventually I [F]know, I [G]know
