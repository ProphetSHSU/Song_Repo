Lyrics:

[A]Pretty Woman     Walking [F#m]down the street
Pretty [A]Woman     The kind I [F#m]like to meet
Pretty [D]Woman    I don't be[E]lieve you  You're not the truth
No one can look as good as you[E7]

(mercy)

Pretty [A]Woman     Won't you [F#m]pardon me
Pretty [A]Woman     I couldn't [F#m]help but see
Pretty [D]Woman     You look so [E]lovely as can be
Are you lonely just like me[E7]

(growl)

[Dm]Pretty Woman s[G]top awhile
[C]Pretty Woman [Am]talk awhile
[Dm]Pretty Woman [G7]give your smile to [C]me
[Dm]Pretty woman [G]Yeah Yeah Yeah
[C]Pretty Woman [Am]look my way

[Dm]Pretty Women [G7]say you'll stay with [C]me[A]
Cause I [F#m]need you         [Dm]   I'll treat you [E]right[A]
Come with me [F#m]baby        [Dm]   Be mine to[E7]night
Pretty [A]Woman     Don't [F#m]walk on by
Pretty [A]Woman     Don't [F#m]make me cry
Pretty [D]Woman     Don't [E]walk away hey ok

If that's the way it must be, okay

I guess I'll go on home   It's late

There'll be tomorrow night but wait
what do I see[E7]

Is she walking back to me yeah

she's walking back to me
Oh ho pretty [A]woman
