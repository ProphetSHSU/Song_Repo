[Em][G][Em][G]

Verse:
[G]Hey little girl is your daddy home
Did he go away and leave you all alone[C]

I got a bad de[Em]sire

[C]Oh, oh, [D]oh, I'm on [G]fire

Tell me now baby is he good to you

Can he do to you the things that I do[C]

I can take you [Em]higher

[C]Oh, oh, [D]oh, I'm on [G]fire  [2x]
Instrumental:

Verse:
[C]It's like someone took a knife

Edgy and dull and cut a [Em]six-inch valley

Through the [C]middle of my skull

At [G]night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet

And a freight train running through the middle of my [C]head

Only you can cool my de[Em]sire

[C]Oh, oh, [D]oh I'm on [G]fire

[C]Oh, oh, [D]oh I'm on [G]fire

[C]Oh, oh, [D]oh I'm on [Em]fire
