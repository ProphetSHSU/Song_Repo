[A]Back this hitch up into the water
Untie all the cables and rope

Get yourself a coozie

Floating is all I want to do
[D]You can climb the ladder
Just don't rock the boat while I barbeque[A]

 
 
Chorus:
On the [D]pontoon
Making waves and catching rays up [A]on the roof
Jumping out the back, don't act like you don't [E]want to
Party in slow motion
[A]Out here in the open
Mm motorboating

Don't drink it if the mountains aren't blue
