[Intro]
[A]

 
 
[Verse 1]
You [A]wake up late for school man you don't wanna go
You ask you mom, "Please?" but she still says, "No!"
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk

 
 
Chorus:
You gotta [D]fight  for your right to [A]party

Verse 2:
You [A]pops caught you smoking and he said, "No way!"
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag

 
 
Chorus:
You gotta [D]fight  for your right to [A]party[E]

 
 
Verse 3:
[A]  Don't [A]step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said, "What's that noise?"
Aw, mom you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys!
 
 
Chorus:
You gotta [D]fight  for your right to [A]party
You gotta [D]fight  for your right to [A]party
 
 
Outro:
[E A]Party
Party
