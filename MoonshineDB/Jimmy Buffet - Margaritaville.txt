Verse:
[D]Nibblin' on sponge cake, watchin' the sun bake
All of those tourists covered with [A]oil
[A]Strummin' my six string, on my front porch swing
Smell those shrimp they're beginnin' to[D] boil[D7]

Chorus:
[G]   Wastin' a[A]way again in Margar[D]itaville,[D7]     
[G]   searchin' for m[A]y lost shaker of [D]salt[D7]
[G]   Some people [A]claim that there's a [D]woma[A/C#]n to b[G]lame, 
but I [A]know, it's nobody's [D]fault

Verse:
[D]Don't know the reason, I stayed here all season
Nothin' to show but this brand new tat[A]too
[A]But it's a real beauty, a Mexican cutie
How it got here I haven't a [D]clue[D7]

Chorus:
[G]   Wastin' a[A]way again in Margar[D]itaville,[D7]     
[G]   searchin' for m[A]y lost shaker of [D]salt[D7]
[G]   Some people [A]claim that there's a [D]woma[A/C#]n to 
b[G]lame, now I [A]think, hell it could be my [D]fault

Instrumental:
[D][A]

[G] [A][D][A/C#][G][A][D]

Verse:
[D]I blew out my flip flop, stepped on a pop top
Cut my heal had to cruise on back [A]home
[A]But there's booze in the blender, and soon it will render
That frozen concoction that helps me han[D]g on[D7]

Chorus:
[G]   Wastin' a[A]way again in Margar[D]itaville,[D7]     
[G]   searchin' for m[A]y lost shaker of [D]salt[D7]
[G]   Some people [A]claim that there's a [D]woma[A/C#]n to 
bl[G]ame, but I [A]know, it's my own damn [D]fault[D7]
Yes and, [G]  some people [A]claim that there's a [D]woma[A/C#]n to 
b[G]lame, and I [A]know, it's my own damn [D]fault
