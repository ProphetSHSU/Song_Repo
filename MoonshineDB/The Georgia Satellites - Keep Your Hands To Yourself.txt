Intro:
[A]

Verse 1:
I got a little [A]change in my pocket going jingalingaing
Wants to call you on the telephone, baby, uh, give you a ring
But [D]each time we talk, I get the same old thing
Always, "No [A]huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding ring"
My [E7]honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said, "Don't [A]hand me no lines and keep your [E7]hands to yourself”

 
Verse 2:
[A]

Ooh, baby, [A]baby, baby, why you wan' treat me this a, way?
You know I'm still your loverboy, I still feel the same way
That's when she [D]told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow
And said, "No [A]huggee, no kissee until I get a wedding vow"
My [E7]honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said, "Don't [A]hand me no lines and keep your [E7]hands to yourself”

Verse 3:
You see, I wanted [A]her real bad and I was about to give in
Uh, that's when she started talking about true love, started talking about sin
I said, [D]"Honey, I'll live with you for the rest of my life"
She said, "No [A]huggee, no kissee until you make me a wife"
My [E7]honey, my baby, don't put my love upon no shelf
She said, "Don't [A]hand me no lines and keep your [E7]hands to yourself”
