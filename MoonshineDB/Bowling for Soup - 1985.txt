Verse 1:
[B5]Debbie just hit the wall
[E5]She never had it all
[Ab5]One Prozac a day
[F#5]Husband's a CPA

[B5]Her dreams went out the door
[E5]When she turned twenty four
[Ab5]Only been with one man
[F#5]What happen to her plan?

[B5]She was gonna be an actress
[E5]She was gonna be a star
[Ab5]She was gonna shake her ass
[F#5]On the hood of white snake's car

[B5]Her yellow SUV  
[E5]is now the enemy
[Ab5]Looks at her average life
[F#5]And nothing has been alright 
 
 
Chorus:
since Bruce [B5]Springsteen, Madonna
[E5]Way before Nirvana    
There was [Ab5]U2 and Blondie
[A5]And music still on MTV

Her [B5]two kids in high school
They [E5]tell her that she's uncool
'Cause [Ab5]she's still preoccupied
[A5] With nineteen, nineteen, nineteen eighty five (oo hoo hoo, oo hoo hoo)

[B5 E5]Nineteen eighty five [Ab5 F#5]

[E5]She knows every line
[Ab5]Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink
[F#5]Even Saint Elmo's Fire

[B5]She rocked out to Wham
[E5]Not a big Limp Bizkit fan
[Ab5]Thought she'd get a hand
[F#5]On a member of Duran Duran

[B5]Where's the miniskirt  
[E5]made of snake skin
[Ab5]And who's the other guy that's [F#5]singing in Van Halen

[B5]When did reality  
[E5]become T. V.
[Ab5]Whatever happened to   
[F#5]sitcoms, game shows
On the radio was

[B5]Springsteen, Madonna
[E5]Way before Nirvana    
There was [Ab5]U2 and Blondie

Bridge:
[B5]She hates time  [E5]make it stop
[G#5]When did Motley Crue become [F#5]classic rock?

[B5]And when did Ozzy  [E5]become an actor?            
Please make [E5]this   [F#5]stop stop
Stop!
