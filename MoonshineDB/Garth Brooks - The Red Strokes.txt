Intro:
[A] [F#m][Dmaj7][E7]

Verse:
[A]Moonlight on canvas, [Asus2]midnight and [A]wine
[F#m]Two shadows starting [D]to softly com[E]bine
The [A]picture they're painting, [Asus2]is one of the [A]heart
And to [F#m]those who have seen it, [E]it's a true work of art

Chorus:
Oh, [A]the red strokes, [E]passions un[F#m]caged
[D]Thundering moments, [E]of tenderless [E7]rage
Oh, [A]the red strokes, [E]tempered and [F#m]strong
Burning the [E]night like the [Dsus2]dawn

Verse:
[A]Steam on the window, [Asus2]salt in a [A]kiss
[F#m]Two hearts have never [D]pounded like [E]this
Ins[A]pired by a vision, [Asus2]that they can't [A]command
[F#m]Erasing the borders, [E]with each brush of a hand

Chorus:
Oh, [A]the red strokes, [E]passions un[F#m]caged
[D]Thundering moments, [E]of tenderness [E7]rage
Oh, [A]the red strokes, [E]tempered and [F#m]strong
Burning the [E]night like the [Dsus2]dawn

Instrumental:
[A][E][F#m][D][E]

[A] [E][F#m][E][Dsus2]

Bridge:
[F#m]Oh, the blues will be [E]blue and [D]the jealousies [A]green
But when [F#m]love picks its [E]shade, [Esus4]it demands to be [E]seen[E7]

Chorus:
Oh, [A]the red strokes, [E]passions un[F#m]caged
[D]Thundering moments, [E]of tenderness [E7]rage
Oh, [A]the red strokes, [E]tempered and [F#m]strong
Burning the [E]night like the [Dsus2]dawn

Chorus:
Oh, [A]the red strokes, [E]passions un[F#m]caged
[D]Thundering moments, [E]of tenderness [E7]rage
Oh, [A]the red strokes, [E]tempered and [F#m]strong
Burning the [E]night like the [Dsus2]dawn

Outro:
[A]Steam on the window, [Asus2]salt in a [A]kiss
[F#m]Two hearts have never, [D]pounded like [E]this
