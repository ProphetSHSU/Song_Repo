[Em]  Last night I dreamed you were [D]back again
[C]  Larger than [G]life again, [D]holding me [Em]tight again
[Em]  Placing those same kisses [D]on my brow
[C]  Sweeter than [G]ever now [D]Lord I rem[Em]ember how

[D]No you don't, but I [A]do

[Em]All that I can hear is your song[D]haunting me
[C]Can't get the [G]melody  [D]  out of my[Em]head, you see

[C]Things might be [G]just as good, [D]  always bel[Em]ieved they would
