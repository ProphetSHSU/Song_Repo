Verse 1:
i have [G]climbed highest mountains

i have run through the fields
only to [Csus2]be with you, only to [G]be with you
i have[G]run, i have crawled
i have scaled these city walls, these city [Csus2]walls
only to [G]be with you

Chorus 1:
[D]but i still ha[Csus2]ven't found wha[G]t i'm looking for
[D]but i still ha[Csus2]ven't found wha[G]t i'm looking for

Verse 2:
I h[G]ave kissed honey lips

Felt the healing in her fingertips
it burned like [Csus2]fire, this burning de[G]sire
i have [G]spoke with the tounge off angels

i have held the hand of the devil
it was warm in the [Csus2]night, i was cold as a [G]stone

but i [D]still haven't [Csus2]found what i'm [G]looking for

Verse 3:
[G]i believe in the kingdom come

then all the colours they will
bleed into one, bleed into [Csus2]one
but yes i'm still [G]running
you broke the bonds an[G]d you loosed the chains
carried the cross of, of my shame, of my [Csus2]shame
you know i be[G]lieve it

Chorus 3:
but i [D]still haven't [Csus2]found what i'm [G]looking for
but i [D]still haven't [Csus2]found what i'm [G]looking for
but i [D]still haven't [Csus2]found what i'm [G]looking for
but i [D]still haven't [Csus2]found what i'm [G]looking for
