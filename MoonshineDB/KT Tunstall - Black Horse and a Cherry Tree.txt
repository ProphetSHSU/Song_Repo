Intro:
[Em B7 Em B7] 
[Em] Well my heart knows me better

Verse:
Then I know myself so
I'm going to let it do all the talking
[B7]   [Em]I came across a place
In the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse
And a cherry tree
[B7]   [Em]I felt a little fear upon my back
I said don't look back, just keep on walking
[B7]   [Em]Well the big black horse said, "Look this way."
He said, "Hey lil' lady
Will you marry me?"

Chorus:
[B7]   [Em]  But I said, [Em]No no,[D] no no[C]no no
I said, [Em]No no[D]
You're[C] not the one for me[Em]
No no,[D] no no[C]no no
I said, [Em]No no,[D]  [C]you're not the one for [Em]me

Verse:
And my [Em]heart had a problem in the early hours
So I stopped it dead for a beat or two
[B7]   [Em]But I cut some cord and I shouldn't have done it
And it won't forgive me after all these years
[B7]   [Em]So I sent her to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
[B7]   [Em]Now it won't come back cause its oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see,

Chorus:
[B7]   [Em]  And it said, [Em]No no,[D] no no[C]no no
I said, [Em]No no[D]
You're[C] not the one for me[Em]
No no,[D] no no[C]no no
I said, [Em]No no,[D]  [C]you're not the one for [Em]me

Bridge:
I said,[Em]No no, no no no no no
No no
You're not the one for me
No no, no no no no no
No no
You're not the one for me

Outro:

Big black [D]horse[C] and a cherry tree[Em]
I can't quite get[D] there cause my [C]heart's
Forsaken [Em]me
