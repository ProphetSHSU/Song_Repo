Intro:
[E]

Verse:
[E]Out in the country past the city limits sign
Well there's a honky tonk near the county line
The [A7]joint starts jumpin' every night when the sun goes [E]down
They got whis[B7]key, women, music, and smoke
It's where all the cowboy folk go to boot [A7]scootin' [E]boogie

Verse:
I've [E]got a good job, I work hard for my money
When it's quittin' time I hit the door runnin'
I [A7]fire up my pickup truck and let the horses [E]run
I go flyin'[B7]down that highway to that hideaway
Stuck out in the woods to do the boot [A7]scootin' [E]boogie

Chorus:
Yeah, [A7]heel, toe, dosido come on baby let's go [E]boot scootin'
Oh [A7]Cadillac blackjack, baby meet me outback we're gonna [E]boogie
Oh [B7]get down, turn around, go to town, boot [A7]scootin' [E]boogie

Piano Solo:
[E] [A7][E][B7][E]

Verse:
The [E]bartender asks me, says son what'll it be
I want a shot of that redhead yonder lookin' at me
The [A7]dance floor's hoppin' and it's hotter than the fourth of July[E]
I see out[B7]laws, inlaws, crooks and straights all out makin' it shake
Doin' the boot [A7]scootin' [E]boogie

Chorus:
Yeah, [A7]heel, toe, dosido come on baby let's go [E]boot scootin'
Oh [A7]Cadillac blackjack, baby meet me outback we're gonna [E]boogie
Oh [B7]get down, turn around, go to town, boot [A7]scootin' [E]boogie
Oh, [A7]heel, toe, dosido come on baby let's go [E]boot scootin'
Yeah [A7]Cadillac blackjack, baby meet me outback we're gonna [E]boogie
Yeah [B7]get down, turn around, go to town, boot [A7]scootin' [E]boogie
