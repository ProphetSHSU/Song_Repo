Verse 1:
[D]Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonight, shinin' through the trees
[G]Crickets are singin' and lightning bugs are floatin' on the breeze,   
Baby get [D]ready

[D]Across the field where the creek turns back by the old stump road
[G]I'm gonna take you to a special place that nobody knows
Baby get [D]ready, [A]oooh oohooh

Chorus:
[D]You and me going fishin' in the dark
[D]Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the [G]cool grass grows
 
[D]Down by the river in the full moonlight
[D]We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just [G]movin' slow

[Em]Stayin' the whole night [A]through
[Em]Feels so good to [A]be with [D]you
 
Verse 2:
[D]Spring is almost over and the summer's comin', the days are gettin' long
[G]Waited all winter for the time to be right, just to take you along
Baby get [D]ready

[D]And it don't matter if we sit forever and the fish don't bite
[G]We'll jump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the night
Baby get [D]ready, [A]ooh oohooh

Chorus:
[D]You and me going fishin' in the dark
[D]Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the [G]cool grass grows
 
[D]Down by the river in the full moonlight
[D]We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just [G]movin' slow

[Em]Stayin' the whole night [A]through
[Em]Feels so good to [A]be with [D]you

D]You and me going fishin' in the dark
[D]Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the [G]cool grass grows
 
[D]Down by the river in the full moonlight
[D]We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just [G]movin' slow
 
[D]You and me going fishin' in the dark
[D]Lying on our backs and counting the stars
Where the [G]cool grass grows
 
[D]Down by the river in the full moonlight
[D]We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just [G]movin' slow

[Em]Stayin' the whole night [A]through
[Em]Feels so good to [A]be with [D]you
