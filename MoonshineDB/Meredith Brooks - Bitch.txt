Intro:
[A] [D]

Verse:
[A]  [D] I [A]hate the world today
[D] You're so good to me, I know,[A]but I can't change
[D] Tried to tell you but you [F#m]look at me like maybe
I'm an an[Bsus2]gel underneath
[D]Innocent and sweet
[A]Yesterday I cried
[D] You must have been relieved to see[A]the softer side
[D] I can understand how you'd[F#m]be so confused
[Bsus2]I    don't envy you
I'm a [D]little bit of everything all rolled into one

Chorus:
I'm a [A]bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a [E]child, I'm a mother
I'm a [Bm]sinner, I'm a saint
I [D]do not feel ashamed
I'm your [A]Hell, I'm your dream
I'm [E]nothing in between
You know you [F#m]wouldn't want it any other [D]way

Verse:
So [A]take me as I am
[D] This may mean you'll have to be[A]a stronger man
[D] Rest assured that when I start[F#m]to make you nervous
And I'm go[Bsus2]ing to extremes
To[D]morrow I will change and today won't mean a thing

Chorus:
I'm a [A]bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a [E]child, I'm a mother
I'm a [Bm]sinner, I'm a saint
I [D]do not feel ashamed
I'm your [A]Hell, I'm your dream
I'm [E]nothing in between
You know you [F#m]wouldn't want it any other [D]way

Interlude:
[A][E][F#m][D]

[A] [E][Bm][D]

Bridge:
[E]Just when you think you got me figured out
The [F#m]season's already chan[D]ging
[E] I think it's cool, you [F#m]do what you do
And [D]don't try to save me

Chorus:
I'm a [A]bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a [E]child, I'm a mother
I'm a [Bm]sinner, I'm a saint
I [D]do not feel ashamed
I'm your [A]Hell, I'm your dream
I'm [E]nothing in between
You know you [F#m]wouldn't want it any other [D]way
I'm a [A]bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a [E]goddess on my knees
When you [Bm]hurt, when you suffer
I'm your [D]angel undercover
I've been [A]numb, I'm revived
Can't [E]say I'm not alive
You know I [F#m]wouldn't want it any other way[D]
