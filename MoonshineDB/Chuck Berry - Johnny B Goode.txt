Intro:

[Eb]

[Bb]

Verse:
Way [Bb]down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens.
There [Eb]stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,
Where [Bb]lived a country boy named Johnny B Good.
He [F]never ever learned to read and write so well,
But he could [Bb]play the guitar just like the ringin' a bell.

Chorus:
Go, g[Bb]o.
Go, Johnny go, go.
Go, Johnny go, g[Eb]o.
Go, Johnny go, g[Bb]o.
Go, Johnny go, g[F]o.
Johnny B Go[Bb]od.

Verse:
He used to [Bb]carry his guitar in a gunny sack
And sit beneath the trees by the railroad track.
Oh, en[Eb]gineers would see him sitting in the shade
[Bb]Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made.
[F]People passing by they would stop and say:
"Oh, m[Bb]y how that little country boy could play."

Chorus:
Go, g[Bb]o.
Go, Johnny go, go.
Go, Johnny go, g[Eb]o.
Go, Johnny go, g[Bb]o.
Go, Johnny go, g[F]o.
Johnny B Go[Bb]od.

Solo:

[F] [Bb]

Verse:
His [Bb]mama told him: "Someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big old band.
Ma[Eb]ny people coming from miles around
To [Bb]hear you play your music when the sun go down.
Ma[F]ybe someday your name will be in lights
Sayin' [Bb]Johnny B Good tonight."

Chorus:
Go, go, g[Bb]o,
Johnny, go.
Go, go, go, Johnny go.
Oh, go, g[Eb]o, Johnny go.
Oh, go, g[Bb]o, Johnny, go.

Outro:
G[F]o. Johnny B Go[Bb]od.
