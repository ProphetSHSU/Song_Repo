Intro:
[E][D/E][A/E][E]

Verse:
[E]Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow [G#m]parade of fears without c[C#m]rying
Now I w[A]ant to und[E]erstand

I have done all that I could, to see the evil and the good
without hiding.  You must help me if you can

Chorus:
[C#m]Doctor, my eyes, t[E]ell me what is wrong
Was I un[C#m]wise to leave them o[B]pen for so 
lon[A]g[E][D/E][A/E][E]

Verse:
[E]'Cause I have wandered through this world
And as each m[G#m]oment has unfurled,  I've[C#m]been waiting
to awak[A]en from th[E]ese dreams

People go just where they will, I never noticed them until

I got this feeling, that it's later than it seems

Chorus:
[C#m]Doctor, my eyes, te[E]ll me what you see
[C#m]I hear their cries, just say if i[B]t's too late fo[D/E**]r 
me[A][(E][D/E][A/E][E][repeat)]

Instrumental Break:

Chorus:
[C#m]Doctor, my eyes c[E]annot see the sky
[C#m]Is this the prize for having l[B]earned how not to 
c[A]ry[E][D/E][A/E][E]
