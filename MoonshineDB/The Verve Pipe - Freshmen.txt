Verse:
[C]when I was young I knew [F]everything
and [Am]she a punk who rarely ever [G]took [F]advice

[Am]    [G]      [F]I can't be held responsible
[Am]    [G]     'cause [F]she was touching her face
[Am]    [G]      [F]I won't be held responsible
[Am]    [G]      she fell in[F]love in the first place

Chorus 1:
[C]for the life of me, [F]I cannot remember
[Am]what made us think that[G] we were[F] wise and we'd never compr[C]o-mise
for the life of me,[F]I cannot believe
we'd [Am]ever die f[G]or these [F]sins we were merely freshmen

his [Am]girl took a week's wo[G]rth of [F]valium and slept

[Am]thinks about her now and [G]how he nev[F]er really wept, he says...

[Am]we fell through the ice, wh[G]en we t[F]ried not to slip, we'd say it...
