Verse 1: 
Well, some[Eb]times I go out by myself

{c: Harmonize} 
Chorus: 
'Cos [Ab]since I've come on home, well my b[Gm]ody's been a mess
And I've [Ab]missed your ginger hair and the w[Gm]ay you like to dress
[Ab] Won't you come on over, [Gm]stop making a fool out of m[Bb]e

Verse 2: 
Did you [Eb]have to go to jail, put your house on up for sale, 
did you get a good la[Fm]wyer
I hope you [Eb]didn't catch a tan, I hope you found the right man 
who'll fix it for [Fm]ya
Are you [Eb]shoppin' anywhere, changed the colour of your hair, 
ar[Fm]e you busy?
And did you [Eb]have to pay that fine you was dodging all the time, 
are you still d[Fm]izzy?
