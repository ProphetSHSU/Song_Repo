Intro:
[D] I was all [D]right for awhile
I could smile for awhile

{c: arpegios}
Verse:
(But I saw you last night)
(You held my [Daug]hand so tight)
(As you [G][N.C.]stopped to say, "Hel[Gm]lo")

Oh, you [D]wished me well
You,[A7]you couldn't tell

Chorus:
That I'd been [D]crying [F#m]over you
[D]Crying [F#m]over you
When [G]you said, "So [A]long"
Left me [G]standing all a[A]lone
Alone and [D]crying, [Daug]crying
[G]Crying, [Gm]crying

Post-Chorus:
It's hard to [D]understand
(But the [A7]touch of your hand)
(Can start me [D]crying)

{c: arpegios}
Verse:
I thought that I[D]was over you
But it's truuuuue, so true
I love you even more
Than I [Daug]did before
But, [G][N.c]darling, what can I [Gm]do?
For you [D]don't love me

(And I'll [A7]always be [D]crying [F#m]over you)

Chorus:
([D]Crying [F#m]over you)
{c: D2 roy part}
[G]Yes, now you're[A]gone
And[G] from this moment [A]on
I'll be [D]crying, [Daug]crying
[G]Crying, [Gm]crying

Outro:
I'm [D]crying, cry[Bm]ing
[G]Ov[A]er [D]you[A][D][G][D]
