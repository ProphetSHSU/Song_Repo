Verse 1:
I'm packed and I'm [G]holding, I'm smiling,
She's [D]living, she's [Dsus4]golden, she [C]lives for me
She says she lives for me
[G]Ovation her [D]own moti[Dsus4]vation
[C]She comes around and she goes down on [G]me

And I make her s[D]mile like a [Dsus4]drug for you
[C]Do ever what you want to do
Coming over [G]you
Keep on smi[D]ling what we go [Dsus4]through
[C]One stop to the rhythm that divides you

Pre-Chorus:
[G]And I speak to you [D]like the [Dsus4]chorus to the [C]verse
Chop another line like a coda with a [G]curse
Come on like a [D]freak show [Dsus4]takes the [C]stage
We give them the games we play she said

Chorus 1:
[G]I want [D]somet[Dsus4]hing e[C]lse
To get me through this[G]
[D]Semi-charmed ki[Dsus4]nd of [C]life baby, baby

Verse 2:
The sky it was [G]gold, it was rose
I was [D]taking sips [Dsus4]of it through my [C]nose
And I wish I could get back there
Some place [G]back there
Smiling in the [D]pictures you would [Dsus4]take
[C]Doing crystal meth will lift
you up until you break

It won't s[G]top I won't come [D]down
I keep [Dsus4]stock with a [C]tick-tock
rhythm, a bump for the drop
And then I [G]bumped up
I took the [D]hit that I was [Dsus4]given
Then I [C]bumped again
Then I bumped again, said

{d_time:01:39}
Pre-Chorus:
[D]  How do I get b[C]ack there to
The pl[D]ace where I

The pl[D]ace where you said

Verse 3:
{c:LISA PART!!}
[G]I believe in the [D]sand
beneath my [C]toes
The beach gives a feeling
An earthy [G]feeling
I be[D]lieve in the
faith that [C]grows
And the four right
chords can [G]make me cry[D][Dsus4]

[C]When I'm with you I
feel like I could [G]die
And that would be 
[D]all [Dsus4]right,   [C]all right

Bridge:
and when the pl[D]ane came in
She s[C]aid she was crashing[D]
The velvet it r[C]ips in
the city we tr[D]ipped
On the urge to f[C]eel alive
But n[G]ow I'm struggling
to survive
{c:/LISA PART!}

{d_time:02:35}
Those d[D]ays you were wearing
That v[C]elvet dress
Y[D]ou're the priestess
I m[C]ust confess

Those [D]little red panties
They p[C]ass the test
Slide [G]up around the belly face down on the mattress

[D]One [C]
And you h[D]old me[C]
and we're br[D]oken[C]
Still it's [G]all that I
wanna do just a little now

{d_time:02:50}
Verse 4:
[G]Feel myself [D]head
made o[Dsus4]f the [C]ground
I'm scared I'm not coming
[G]down[D], [Dsus4]no     [C]no, and I won't
run for [G]my life[D][Dsus4]
[C]She's got her jaws now
locked down in a s[G]mile
But nothing is [D]alrig[Dsus4]ht,   [C]alright

{d_time:03:10}

{c:QUIET}
[G]I want [Dsus4]something [C]else
To get me [G]through this[Dsus4]
[C]life, baby
[G]I want [Dsus4]something [C]else
I'm not listening
[G]when you [Dsus4]say 
goo[C]dbye[G/B][Am]
