Intro:
[G G#dim7 Am7 D]
 
[Verse 1]
 Blame it [G]all on my roots, I [G#dim7]showed up in boots and [Am7]ruined your black tie affair
 The [D]last one to know, the [D]last one to show
 I was the [G]last one you thought you'd see there
 And I [G]saw the surprise and the [G#dim7]fear in his eyes when [Am7]I took his glass of [Cm]champagne
[D]I toasted you, said honey we may be through but you'll never hear me complain
 
 
Chorus:
'Cause [G]I got friends in low places where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My [Am]blues away and I'll [D]be okay
[G]I'm not big on social graces, think I'll slip on down to the oasis
oh, [Am]I've got friends[D] in low [G]places
 
 
Solo:
| [G] | [G] | [G] | [G] | [Am] | [D] | [G] | [G] |

[Verse 2] (as before)
Well, I [G]guess I was wrong, I [G#dim7]just don't belong but [Am7]then, I've been there before
[D]Everything's alright, I'll just say goodnight
And I'll [G]show myself to the door
Hey, [G]I didn't mean to [G#dim7]cause a big scene, just [Am7]give me an hour, and [Cm]then
[D]I'll be as high as that ivory tower that you’re livin’ in
 
 
[Chorus]
'Cause [G]I got friends in low places where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My [Am]blues away and I'll [D]be okay
[G]I'm not big on social graces, think I'll slip on down to the oasis
oh, [Am]I've got friends[D] in low [G]places
 
 
[Verse 3]
I [G]guess I was wrong, I [G#dim7]just don't belong but [Am7]then, I've been there before
And [D]everything's alright, I'll [D7]just say goodnight
And I'll [G]show myself to the door

[G]I didn't mean to [G#dim7]cause a big scene just [Am7]wait 'til I finish this [Cm]glass
Then [D]sweet little lady I'll head back to the bar[D7]and you can kiss my ass

 
[Chorus]
'Cause [G]I got friends in low places where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My [Am]blues away and I'll [D]be okay
[G]I'm not big on social graces, think I'll slip on down to the oasis
oh, [Am]I've got friends[D] in low [G]places
 
'Cause [G]I got friends in low places where the whiskey drowns and the beer chases
My [Am]blues away and I'll [D]be okay
[G]I'm not big on social graces, think I'll slip on down to the oasis
oh, [Am]I've got friends[D] in low [G]places
