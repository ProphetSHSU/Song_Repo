Verse:
[F]   P[G]ut on [C]my blue sue[Am]de shoes
   And I [F]board[G]ed the [C]plane[Am]

   [F]In the middle of the [G]pouring [C]rain[Am]

Chorus:
[C]   Then I[Am]'m walking [F]in Memp[G]his [C]
   [Am]Walking with my [F]feet ten [G]feet off of [C]Beale

   Then I [F]watched him [G]walk right [C]through[Am]
   Now se[F]curity they [G]did not [C]see him[Am]
   They just [F]hovered '[G]round his [C]tomb[Am]
   But there's a [F]pretty little [G]thing, [C]Waiting for the [Am]King
   N.C.
   Down in the Jungle Room 

Chorus:
[C]   Then I[Am]'m walking [F]in Memp[G]his [C]
