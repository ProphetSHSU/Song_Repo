Intro:
[G]

Verse:
[G]I was Cleopatra, I was young and an actress
When you knelt by my mattress, and asked for my [D]hand
But I was [G]sad you asked it, as I laid in a black dress
With my father in a casket, I had no [D]plans

Break:
[G]

Pre-Chorus:
[G]And I left the footprints, the mud [C]stained on the [G]carpet
And it hardened like my heart did when you left [D]town
But I [G]must admit it, that I would [C]marry you in an i[G]nstant
Damn your wife, I'd be your mistress just to have you [D]around

Chorus:
But I was [G]late for [D]this, [C]late for [G]that, [C]late for the [G]love of my [D]life
And when I [G]die [D]alone, when I [C]die [G]alone, when I [C]die I'll [G]be on [D]time

Break:
[G]

Pre-Chorus Ii:
While the [G]church discouraged, any [C]lust that burned within [G]me
Yes my flesh, it was my currency, but I held [D]true
So I [G]drive a taxi, and the [C]traffic [G]distracts me
From the [C]strangers in my [G]backseat, they remind me [D]of you

Chorus:
But I was [G]late for [D]this, [C]late for [G]that, [C]late for the [G]love of my [D]life
And when I [G]die [D]alone, when I [C]die [G]alone, when I [C]die I'll [G]be on [D]time

Bridge:
And the [Em]only gifts from my [G]Lord were a [C]birth [D]and a [Em]divorce
But I've [G]read this script and the [Em]costume fits, [C]so I'll p[D]lay my [G]part

Break:
[G]

Pre-Chorus Ii:
I was [G]Cleopatra, I was [C]taller than the [G]rafters
But that's all in the past now, gone with the [D]wind
Now a [G]nurse in white shoes [C]leads me back to my [G]guestroom
It's a [C]bed and a [G]bathroom
And a place for the [D]end

Chorus:
I won't be l[G]ate for [D]this, [C]late for [G]that, [C]late for the [G]love of my [D]life
And when I [G]die [D]alone, when I [C]die [G]alone, when I [C]die I'll [G]be on [D]time

End:
[D][G]
