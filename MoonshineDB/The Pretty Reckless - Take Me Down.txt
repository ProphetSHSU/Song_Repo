Verse:
[E] Been [E]waitin' at these crossroads
For[Asus4/E]ever and a day
On a [Asus4/E]guy    to buy my[E]soul
I spend all night and day
How much [Asus4/E]harder can I play
You know I [Asus4/E]gave   my life to Rock [E]n' Roll
Here we [Asus4/E]go     [F#m/E][E]
Momma begged me please
Yes, she [Asus4/E]got    down on her knees
Said 'You'll [A/E]burn in that Mississippi[E]sun'
But I'm the only one that's standing here
So [Asus4/E]Mama don't you have no fear
I'm ei[A/E]ther last or I've already w[E]on
Here I [G5/E]go  [A/E][E]

[E]Standing at the crossroads
A [Asus4/E]dried  up pen in hand
The [Asus4/E]conversation went like [E]this
'Tell me your desire why you pul[Asus4/E]led    me from the fire
And we'll [Asus4/E]seal   the deal with a[E]kiss
Said wanna raise the dead
Find a note[Asus4/E]that I can shred
On my [Asus4/E]walls  I scrawl my[E]gods
Don't care what happens when I die
As [Asus4/E]long   as I'm alive
[D5]All I wanna do is [E]rock, rock, rock!
