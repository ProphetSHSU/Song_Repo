[G]Birds beneath my [C/G]window d[G]ustying their w[C/G]ings upon the l[G]awn[C/G][G][C/G]
[G]I hear them in the [C/G]morning light [G]last amen to a [C/G]migratory son[G]g[C/G][G][C/G]
[G]They’re never looking [C/G]round for me—-their [G]eyes are on the [C/G]sky or the ground belo[G]w[C/G][G][C/G]
[G]I’d rather be the [C/G]one who loves than [G]to be loved and [C/G]never even kn[G]ow[C/G][G][C/G][etc.]

[C/G]Hello blackbird, [Bmin11]hello starling
[C]winter’s over [Dsus4]be my darling
it’s been[G] a long time [C/G]coming
but [G]now the s[C/G]now is gone[etc.]

you were beautiful when I first saw your feathers and confectionery airs
like the earth it up and promised you the stars but you really didn’t care
I sang in exultation pulled the stops—you always looked a little bored
but I’m singing for the love of it—have mercy on the man who sings to be adored
hello blackbird hello starling
winter’s over be my darling
it’s been a long time coming
but now the snow is gone
it’s been a long time coming
but now the snow is gone

I’m underneath your window now—it’s long after the birds have gone to roost
and I’m not sure if I’m singing for the love of it or for the love of you
but I’ve flown a long way honey hear my confession then I’ll go
I’d rather be the one who loves than to be loved and never even know

hello brown one hello blue one
last night’s feathers exchanged for new ones
hello blackbird hello starling
winter’s over be my darling
it’s been a long time coming
but now the snow is gone
