Verse:
[Bm]  I need you to [G]understand

[Bm]  The kind of man you [G]want in the end
Only [C#m7]then can I begin to [F#]live again

{c:hit hit hit}
[Bm]An empty shell
[G]I used to be
[C#m7]    The shadow of my [F#]life
Was hangin over me

[Bm]A broken man
[G]But I don't know
[C#m7]    Won't even stand the [F#]devil's dance
To win my soul

Verse:
What we [Bm]doin'? What we chasin'?
What a[G]bout 'em, why the basement?
Why we [C#m7]got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the [F#]feel for the need to replace me?

You on a [Bm]runway track from the good
I want to paint in the [G]pictures any way we could, react
Like the [C#m7]heart in a trash where you should
You done gave it a[F#]way, ya' had it till you took it back

But I[Bm]keep walkin' on Keep rockin' dawns
[G]Keep walking forward Now the court is yours
[C#m7]Keep browsin' halls 'Cause I don't wanna [F#]live in a broken home Girl I'm beggin'
