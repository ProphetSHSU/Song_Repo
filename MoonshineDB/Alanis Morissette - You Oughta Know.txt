Verse 1:
[F#m7add13]I want you to know, that [B7]I'm happy for you
[F#m7add13]I wish nothing but the [B7]best for you both

{c:<Arpeggios>}
An older [F#m7add13]version of me
Is she perverted like me?
Would she go [B7]down on you in a theater?
Does she speak [F#m7add13]eloquently
And would she have your baby?
I'm sure she'd [B7]make a really excellent mother
 
 
Pre-Chorus:
Cause the [F#m7add13]love     that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you
To be [B7]open wide, no
And [F#m7add13]every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
You'd hold me until [B7]you died
'Til you died, but you are still alive

 
Chorus:
{c:</Arpeggios> - one staccato hit downbeat}
And I'm [F#]here,  to [E]remind you
Of the [A]mess you left when you [B]went away
It's not [F#]fair, to [E]deny me
Of the [A]cross I bear that you [B]gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

Verse 2:
{c:<Arpeggios>}
[F#m7add13]You seem very well, [B7]things look peaceful
[F#m7add13]I'm not quite as well, I [B7]thought you should know
Did you [F#m7add13]forget about me, Mister Duplicity?
I hate to [B7]bug you in the middle of dinner
It was a [F#m7add13]slap in the face
How quickly I was replaced
And are you [B7]thinking of me when you fuck her?

 
Pre-Chorus:
Cause the [F#m7add13]love that you gave that we made
Wasn't able to make it enough for you
To be [B7]open wide, no
And [F#m7add13]every time you speak her name
Does she know how you told me
You'd hold me [B7]until you died
'Til you died, but you are still alive
{c:</Arpeggios>}

 
 
Chorus:
{c:/Arpeggios - one staccato hit downbeat}
And I'm [F#]here,  to [E]remind you
Of the [A]mess you left when you [B]went away
It's not [F#]fair, to [E]deny me
Of the [A]cross I bear that you [B]gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

Pre-Chorus:
{c:<Arpeggios>}
'Cause the [F#m7add13]joke that you laid in the bed
That was me and I'm not gonna fade
As soon as you [B7]close your eyes, and you know it
And [F#m7add13]every time I scratch my nails
Down someone else is back I hope you [B7]feel  it
Well, can you feel it?

 
 
Chorus:
And I'm [F#]here,  to [E]remind you
Of the [A]mess you left when you [B]went away
It's not [F#]fair, to [E]deny me
Of the [A]cross I bear that you [B]gave to me
You, you, you oughta know

 
 
Outro:
And I'm [F#]here,  to [E]remind you

You, you, you oughta know
