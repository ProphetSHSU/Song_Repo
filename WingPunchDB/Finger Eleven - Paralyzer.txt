[Em]

Intro:
[Em][A][G][Em]
[A]
[G]

Verse:
[Em]I hold on so nervously
To [F#]me and my drink
I wish it was cooling me[Em]
But so far has not been good
It's [F#]been shitty
And I feel awkward as I should[Em]
This club has got to be
The most [F#]pretentious thing
Since I thought you and me[Em]
Well, I am imagining

Pre-Chorus:
A [Em]dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Chorus:
Well, I'm[Em]not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you[A]
I wanna make you move[G]
Because you're standing still[Em]
If your body matches
What your eyes can do[A]
You'll probably move right through[G]
Me on my way to you

Verse:
[Em]I hold out for one more drink
Before[F#]I think
I'm looking too desperately[Em]
But so far has not been fun
I [F#]should just stay home
If one thing really means one[Em]
This club will hopefully
Be [F#]closed in three weeks
That would be cool with me[Em]
Well, I'm still imagining

Pre-Chorus:
A [Em]dark lit place
Or your place or my place

Chorus:
Well, I'm[Em]not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you[A]
I wanna make you move[G]
Because you're standing still[Em]
If your body matches
What your eyes can do[A]
You'll probably move right through[G]
Me on my way to you[Em][F#]

Break Down:

Pre-Chorus:
[Em]  Well, I'm[Em]not paralyzed

Chorus:
But, I seem to be struck by you[A]
I wanna make you move[G]
Because you're standing still[Em]
If your body matches
What your eyes can do[A]
You'll probably move right through[G]
Me on my way to you
[Em]I'm not paralyzed
But, I seem to be struck by you[A]
I wanna make you move[G]
Because you're standing still[Em]
If your body matches
What your eyes can do[A]
You'll probably move right through[G]
Me on my way to you

Outro:
[Em]   [A] You'll probably move right through[G]
Me on my way to you[Em]
You'll probably move right through[A]
Me on my way to you[G][Em]
