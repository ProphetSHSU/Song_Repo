[E]You and I in a [F#m]little toy shop
buy a [A]bag of balloons with the [B]money we've got
[E]Set them free at the [F#m]break of dawn
'Til [A]one by one, [B]they were gone
[E]Back at base, bugs in[F#m]the software
[A]Flash the message, [B]"Something's out there"
[E]Floating in the [F#m]summer sky
[A]Ninety nine [B]red balloons go b[E]y.[E]

[E]Ninety nine [F#m]red balloons [A]floating in the [B]summer sky
[E]Panic bells, it's [F#m]red alert
There's [A]something here from [B]somewhere else
The [E]war machine, it [F#m]springs to life
[A]Opens up one [B]eager eye
Fo[E]cusing it [F#m]on the sky
As [A]ninety nine [B]red balloons go b[E]y.

[E]Ninety nine dreams [F#m]I  have had
In [A]every one a [B]red balloon
[E]It's all over and I'm [F#m]standin' pretty
[A]In the dust that w[B]as a city
If [E]I could find a [F#m]souvenir
[A]Just to prove the [B]world was here...
And [E]here it is, a [F#m]red balloon
I [A]think of you and [B]let it go.
