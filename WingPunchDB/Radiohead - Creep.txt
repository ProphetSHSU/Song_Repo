Intro:
[E][G#][A][Am]

Verse:
When you were here be[E]fore, couldn't look you in the [G#]eyes

I wish I was [A]special, you're so very [Am]special

But I'm a [E]creep, I'm a [G#]weirdo
What the hell am I doing [A]here? I don't be[Am]long here

Verse:
I don't care if it [E]hurts, I wanna have con[G#]trol
I want a perfect [A]body, I want a perfect [Am]soul
I want you to [E]notice when I'm not a[G#]round
I wish I was [A]special, you're so very [Am]special

Chorus:
[E]

But I'm a [E]creep, I'm a [G#]weirdo
What the hell am I doing [A]here? I don't be[Am]long here

Whatever makes you [E]happy, whatever you [G#]want

But I'm a [E]creep, I'm a [G#]weirdo
What the hell am I doing [A]here? I don't be[Am]long here
I don't be[E]long here
