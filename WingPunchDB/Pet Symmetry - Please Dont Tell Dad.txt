Intro:
[Fmaj7] [C][G6]

Verse:
T[Fmaj7]he last time I stole my father's keys
I co[C]uldn't have been older than [G6]nineteen
I hig[Fmaj7]htailed his car from New Jersey to Willow Grov[C]e[G6]

Chorus:
And you [F]could not see their [G]street signs through the smoke
[Fmaj7][C][G6]
[Fmaj7][G6][C]

Verse:
Between the dum[Fmaj7]pster diving, vandalizing
Subu[C]rban streets and disturbing t[G6]he peace
Ever[Fmaj7]ything we passed, we smashed
It was br[C]oken pavement and shattered gl[G6]ass

Chorus:
And you [F]could not read their [G]street signs through the smoke
[Fmaj7][C][G6] 
Just [F]afterthoughts passing [G]all of the laws we broke
[Fmaj7][C][G6] 
[Fmaj7][G6][C]

Verse:
Considered [Fmaj7]violent and reckless by North [C]Philly detectives
We [Fmaj7]occupied the space where we'd never have a [C]thing to lose
Between the b[Fmaj7]ong rips and knife hits
Protestant [C]booze, stick[Fmaj7]-and-poke tattoos
We were just o[C]ver-privileged youth seeking something to do[C]

Chorus:
And I [F]could not see my [G]street sign through the 
smok[Fmaj7]e[C][G6]
Just an [F]afterthought rushing past [G]all the laws we broke[C]

Outro:
When the mor[Fmaj7]ning came, I wo[G6]ke up in bed back at hom[C]e
