Verse:
[F5]  Where I come from[Bb5]   isn't all that [F5]great. 
My automobile[Bb5] is a piece of [F5]crap. 
My fashion sense[Bb5] is a little whack,
[C5]  And my friends are just as screw[E5]y as [F5]me. 
I didn't go[Bb5] to boarding [F5]schools. Preppy girls[Bb5]
never looked at [F5]me.
Why should [Bb5]they, I ain't no[C5]body. 
Got nothing in my pocket.[E5]

[F5]Beverly Hills...[Bb5]    [C5]Rolling like a [Bb5]celebrity!

Verse:
[F5]  Look at all[Bb5]those movie stars.
[F5]  They're all so [Bb5]beautiful and clean.[F5]  
When the house[Bb5] maids scrub the floors,
[C5]  They get the spaces [E5]in between.
[F5]  I wanna [Bb5]live a life like [F5]that.
I wanna [Bb5]be just like a king.
[F5]  Take my [Bb5]picture by the pool,
[C5]  Ð¡ause I'm the next big [E5]thing in

Break:
[F5]  The truth is...[Bb5]
[F5]I don't stand a chance.[Bb5]
It's [F5]something that you're born in[Bb5]to
and [Bdim]I   just don't belong.[Bb5]
No I [F5]don't.

Verse:
I'm just a [Bb5]no class, beat down [F5]fool,

And watch the stars [E5]play
