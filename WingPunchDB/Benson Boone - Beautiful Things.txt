Intro:
[Eb] [Bb]

Verse:
{c: Jake}
[F] For a [Eb]while there, it was roug[Bb]h
But lately, I've[F] been doin' bet[Gm]ter
Than the last[Eb]  four cold Dece[Bb]mbers I recall

[F] And I see my [Eb]family every mont[Bb]h
I found a girl[F] my parents love[Gm]
She'll come and [Eb]stay the night, and [Bb]I  think I might have it a[F]ll

And I thank[Eb]  God every da[Bb]y
For the girl[F] He sent[Gbdim7]my way
[Gm]  But I [Eb]know the things He give[Bb]s  me, He can take away

[F] And I [Eb]hold you every nigh[Bb]t
And that's a fee[Gm]ling I wan[F]na get used[Eb]to
But there's no man[Cm]  as terrified as the man[F]who stands to lose you
[Eb]  [Bb]   Oh, I hope I don't lo[F]se y[Gm]ou, mmm
[Eb]  Pleas[Bb]e  stay
[F] I [Gm]want you, I need you, oh, [Eb]God
Don't[Bb]take
[F] These beautiful things that I've [Eb]got

Chorus:
{c: Lisa}
Please[Bb]stay
[Gm]  I [F]want you, I need you, oh, [Eb]God
Don't[Bb]take
[Gm]  These [F]beautiful things that I've [Eb]got
Oh,[Bb]  [Gm] ooh[F][Eb]
Please[Bb]  don't[F]take

Verse:
{c: Jake - SUPER QUIET GUITAR}
I found my [Eb]mind, I'm feelin' san[Bb]e
It's been a while,[F] but I'm finding my [Gm]faith
If everything's [Eb]good and it's great, why do [Bb]I  sit and wait 'til it'[F]s gone?
Oh, I'll tell ya, I [Eb]know I've got enoug[Bb]h
I've got [F]peace and [Gbdim7]I've  got[Gm]love
But I'm [Eb]up at night thinkin' [Bb]I  just might lose it a[F]ll

Chorus:
{c: Lisa}
[Eb]  Pleas[Bb]e  stay
[Gm]  I [F]want you, I need you, oh, [Eb]God
Don't[Bb]take
[Gm]  These [F]beautiful things that I've [Eb]got
Oh,[Bb]  [Gm] ooh[F][Eb]

{c: Jake}
Please[Bb]stay
[F] I want you, I need you, oh, [Eb]God
I[Bb]need
[F]These beautiful things that I've got
