Verse:
[B]  Today [C#m]is gonna be the day that they're 
[G#m]gonna throw it back [E]to you
[B]  And by now[C#m],   you should've somehow real
[G#m]ised what you gott[E]a do
Well [B]I don't believe that[C#m] anybody 
[G#m]feels the way I [E]do about you [B]now

And backbeat, the word is on the street that the 
fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you 
never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody 
feels the way I do about you now

[B][C#m][G#m][E]

Pre-Chorus:
And [E]all the roads we [F#m]have to walk are 
[G#m]winding[B]
And [E]all the lights that [F#m]lead us there are 
[G#m]blinding[B]
[E]There are many [F#m]things that I would 
[B]like to say to [G#m]you, but I don't know [C#m]how

Chorus:
Because may[E]be[B][F#m]
You're [G#m]gonna be the one that 
sa[E]ves me[B][F#m]
And [G#m]after 
all[E][B][F#m]
You're my [G#m]wonder
wa[E]ll[B][F#m][G#m]
[E]
