Intro:
[A][Asus4]
[A][Asus4]     

Verse:
All of these li[A]nes across my face
Tell you the sto[E]ry of who I am
So many sto[F#m]ries of where I've been
And how I go[Dsus2]t    to where I am
But these sto[A]ries don't mean [E]anything
When you've [F#m]got no one to [Dsus2]tell them to
It's [A]true
[E]I was made for [A]you[Asus4]

Verse:
[A] I climbed acro[A]ss the mountaintops
Swam all acro[E]ss the ocean blue
I crossed all the li[F#m]nes and I broke all the rules
But baby I bro[Dsus2]ke   them all for you
Oh because e[A]ven when I wa[E]s flat broke
You [F#m]made me feel like a [Dsus2]million bucks
You[A]do
[E]I was made for [A]you[Asus4][A][Asus4]

Verse:
{c: NC}
You see the smile that's on my mouth
{c: arps}
It's hiding the wo[E]rds that don't come out
All of my frie[F#m]nds who think that I'm blessed
They don't know[Dsus2]my head is a mess
No [A]they don't know who I[E]really am
And [F#m]they don't know what I[Dsus2]'ve  been through
Like you[A]do
And [E]I was made for [A]you[Asus4]

Verse:
{c: chugs and ahhhhhs}
[A] All of these [A]lines across my face
Tell you the sto[E]ry of who I am
So many sto[F#m]ries of where I've been
And how I go[Dsus2]t    to where I am
Oh but these [A]stories don't mean [E]anything
When you've [F#m]got no one to [Dsus2]tell them to
It's [A]true
[E]I was made for you[A][Asus4]
[A] Oh yeah,[Asus4]     

Outro:
well it's [A]true
That [E]I was made for[A]you.
