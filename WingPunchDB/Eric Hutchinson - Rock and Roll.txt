Verse:
He’s be[G]en waiting around for the wee[B7]kend
Figuring which club to sn[C]eak in
Fancy dr[A7]inks and fifty-dollar cover ch[G]arge
Lately it’s been a big h[B7]assle
>5Heineken and New C[C]astle<
To make s[A7]ure he’s fitting in and living larg[Bm]e

{d_time: 0:43}
{c: tambourine}
Disr[Am]egard the l[C]ies that he will tell
and what he’s pro[D]bably like 'cause

Get him th[D]rough the night

[C9]If he wants to s[G]tay he stays

Verse:
[G]See her heavy make up and cut t-s[B7]hirt
Every girl out wants to [C]be her
But they l[A7]ook the same already why adjust
[G]Reading the magazine sec[B7]rets
Forgetting the topical re[C]grets
If she co[A7]mes home all alone the nights a b[Bm]ust

{d_time: 1:38}
{c: tambourine}
It’s a [Am]must the sw[C]ivel in her hips

Verse:
[Am]And in a wink[F] they’re on the brink               
F[G]rom drink to d[C]rink and at the [C/B]bar With cash to blow

From s[Am]hot to shot it’s get[F]ting hot
Ad[G]vance the plot to s[C]ee how far
It’s g[Am]onna go

Al[F]l depends so di[G]tch the friends
And g[C]rab a cab
Another ch[Am]ance for cheap romance

D[F]oesn’t count cause the ro[G]om is spinning
Nothing to l[C]ose tonight they b[Bm7]oth a[Bbm7]re wi[Am]nning
And they f[C]all in love as they f[D]all in bed

They sing...
