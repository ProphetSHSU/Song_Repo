Verse:
Some boys[C] kiss me
Some boys hug me
I think they're ok
If they don't[C]     give me proper credit

But they can't see the light
'Cause the[C] boy with the cold hard cash
Is always Mister Right

Some boys[C]romance
Some boys slow dance
That's all right with me

If they can't[C] raise my interest then I

Some boys[C] try and some boys lie but
I don't let them play
Only[C] boys who save their pennies
Make my rainy day
