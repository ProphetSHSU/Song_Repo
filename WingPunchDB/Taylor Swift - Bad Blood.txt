Chorus:
'Cause baby,[Cadd9]Now  we've got prob[G]lems
And I don't [Dsus4]think we can solve[Em7]'em
You made a [Cadd9]really deep cut[G]
And baby, [Dsus4]now  we've got bad[Em7]blood

{c: chugs}
Verse:
[Cadd9]Did  you[G]have to do this?
[Dsus4]I    was thin[Em7]king that you could be trusted
[Cadd9]Did  you[G] have to ruin [Dsus4]what was shi[Em7]ny?
Now it's all rusted
[Cadd9]Did  you[G] have to hit me [Dsus4]where I'm weak?
[Em7]Baby, I couldn't breathe
And [Cadd9]rub  it[G]in so deep
[Dsus4]Salt in the wound [Em7]like you're laughing right at me

{c: big hits}
Pre-Chorus:
[Cadd9]     Oh,[G] it's so s[Dsus4]ad   to[Em7]
Think about the go[Cadd9]od   times[G]
You and I[Dsus4]

{c: dun dun rest}
Chorus:
'Cause baby, [Cadd9]now  we've got bad[G]blood
You know it [Dsus4]used to be mad[Em7]love
So take a [Cadd9]look what you've done[G]
'Cause baby, [Dsus4]now  we've got bad[Em7]blood
{c: big hits}
[Cadd9]Now  we've got prob[G]lems
And I don't [Dsus4]think we can solve[Em7]'em
You made a [Cadd9]really deep cut[G]
And baby, [Dsus4]now  we've got bad[Em7]blood

{c: chugs}
Verse:
[Cadd9]Did  you[G]think we'd be fine?
[Dsus4]Still got scars [Em7]on my back from your knives
So [Cadd9]don't think[G]it's in the past
[Dsus4]These kinds of wounds, [Em7]they last and they last
Now, [Cadd9]did  you[G]think it all through?
[Dsus4]All  these things [Em7]will catch up to you
And [Cadd9]time can[G]heal, but this won't
So [Dsus4]if   you're coming my [Em7]way
Just don't

{c: big hits}
Pre-Chorus:
[Cadd9]     Oh,[G] it's so s[Dsus4]ad   to[Em7]

You and I[Dsus4]

'Cause baby, now  we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now  we've got bad blood
{c: big hits}
[Cadd9]Now  we've got prob[G]lems
And I don't [Dsus4]think we can solve[Em7]'em

[Cadd9]Band-aids don't [G]fix bullet holes
[Dsus4]You  say sor[Em7]ry just for show
If you [Cadd9]live like that,[G]you live with ghosts
[Dsus4]      [Em7]    [Cadd9]Band-aids don't [G]fix bullet holes
[Dsus4]You  say sor[Em7]ry just for show
